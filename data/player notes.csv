1. Saquon Barkley RB - NYG (vs . PHI)
"During his rookie season, while playing behind a shoddy offensive line and in a low-scoring offense, Barkley overcame all odds and delivered a fantasy MVP-worthy performance. He finished as an RB1 in 75 percent of his games, while hitting at least RB2 numbers in 93.8 percent of his games. Some are excited about his target possibilities with Odell Beckham Jr. gone, but it's likely going to bring more attention to him and the run-game. Still, Barkley showed last year that he's able to overcome a lot, making him a relatively safe top-three selection in every format, but the lack of scoring from this offense can really hold him back."

2. Christian McCaffrey RB - CAR (vs . NO)
"McCaffrey blew up in 2018 and it's got everyone reaching for him as a top-three selection in 2019. It's fair and you shouldn't shy away from the three-down back, but you should know that the Panthers have openly talked about scaling back his workload. He's still likely to finish as a top-five option at the position even if he loses 4-6 touches per game, as he's gamescript-proof and it's not as if Cam Newton is rushing for as many touchdowns as he used to."

3. Alvin Kamara RB - NO (at CAR)
"With Mark Ingram's departure, many are likely wondering what it means for Kamara, though the acquisition of Latavius Murray tells us a lot. He's likely going to walk into the old Ingram role, though it's important to note that it's no guarantee he's able to fit in this offense. You remember Adrian Peterson with the Saints, right? He was able to go to the Redskins and get it done, so maybe Sean Payton's offense just isn't right for everyone. Because of that, Kamara gets a slight bump in upside, which was already high to begin with, as he has finished as the RB3 and RB4 in his first two seasons with Ingram on the roster."
2 weeks ago
4. David Johnson RB - ARI (at LAR)
"Now that Steve Wilks is out of town, maybe we'll get back to the normally scheduled programming with Johnson. The air-raid offense that new coach Kliff Kingsbury figures to bring to the Cardinals should give Johnson a lot more work in the passing game. While at Texas Tech, Kingsbury passed the ball on 65 percent of their plays. By comparison, there were just two teams in the NFL who hit that number in 2018. With Kyler Murray presenting elusiveness, it should only help create lanes for Johnson, even if his offensive line is still weak"
3 weeks ago
5. Ezekiel Elliott RB - DAL (vs . WAS)
"Zeke is the biggest risk in the top four but if he plays, he is the best bet to finish #1. He is a durable workhorse behind one of the best offensive lines in football, plus we can expect mostly positive game scripts. Over his career, Zeke averages 2099 yards from scrimmage and 13 touchdowns per 16 games."
6 days ago
6. DeAndre Hopkins WR - HOU (vs . TEN)
"The best hands in football. Hopkins continually makes highlight-worthy grabs on passes that 95 percent of the league couldn't make on their best day. He'll continually see the oppositions best cornerback, but having Will Fuller back will help draw double-coverage away from him. He's now finished as a top-six fantasy receiver in three of the last four seasons, including his first No. 1 finish in 2018"
3 weeks ago
7. Davante Adams WR - GB (at DET)
"To know that he finished as the No. 3 wide receiver in fantasy football despite Aaron Rodgers throwing just 25 touchdowns, it should let you know how high his ceiling actually is. It wasn't just one game, either. It took 14.9 PPR points on average to be a top-24 receiver in 2018, and Adams is the only receiver in the NFL who hit that number in every single one of his games"
3 weeks ago
8. Julio Jones WR - ATL (at TB)
"When he's on the field, you have yourself a guaranteed top-five wide receiver. While health has been an issue in the past, Jones has now played at least 14 games in five straight seasons. Outside of his rookie season and the year he needed surgery on his foot, Jones has been a top-10 receiver in all six of his other seasons. He's a safe pick at the back-end of the first-round"
3 weeks ago
9. James Conner RB - PIT (at BAL)
"When Conner wore down at the end of the 2018 season, did the Steelers get a bit worried? They reached for Benny Snell in the fourth-round of the draft, highlighting they clearly felt running back depth was a need. With Antonio Brown and Jesse James gone, there are over 200 targets that have vacated the team, so it's possible Conner can build upon his strong 2018 season. The slight risk of a timeshare knocks him down into the second round, though he's got top-six upside"
3 weeks ago
10. Nick Chubb RB - CLE (at CIN)
"Some are worried about Chubb due to the signing of Kareem Hunt this offseason, but you shouldn't be one of them. Hunt has an eight-game suspension that will allow Chubb to run with the job, as he did down the stretch last year. The Browns invested a high second-round pick on Chubb and he's done nothing but impress. He's the starter and an RB1 in fantasy"
3 weeks ago
11. Michael Thomas WR - NO (at CAR)
"Three straight top-10 seasons to start your career? Not bad. The Saints are throwing the ball less and less, which is why Thomas hasn't contended for the No. 1 spot in the wide receiver rankings, but he's steady and consistent, making him well worth a late first-round selection"
3 weeks ago
12. Le'Veon Bell RB - NYJ (at BUF)
"He's back, though this time it's probably going to be a lot less exciting. He'll be playing behind a much lesser offensive line, with a much lesser quarterback, in a much worse offense. He's going to get plenty of touches, but we can say that about a lot of running backs. The question is - what's his upside in a low-scoring offense? Adam Gase's offenses have been lacking in both overall plays and overall scoring. Did you know that Dolphins running backs scored 10 rushing touchdowns over the last two years... combined? Bell is a relatively safe pick due to the touches he'll get, but he lacks the upside you want out of a high first-round pick"
3 weeks ago
13. Odell Beckham Jr. WR - CLE (at CIN)
"You have to love the landing spot for Beckham, as he's now tied to a franchise quarterback who's deadly accurate. The issue is that the Browns are a franchise that has tons of talent on the defensive side of the ball, which may limit the amount of pass attempts to go around. Still, you don't trade for Beckham and not use him. He may not belong in the elite tier in year one with the Browns, but it shouldn't shock anyone if he finishes there. He is an outlier"
3 weeks ago
14. Travis Kelce TE - KC (vs . LAC)
"Kelce scored the most fantasy points of any tight end in the last five seasons last year. He may shatter that clip this season and approach Gronk's enormous 2017 total of 331 PPR points if Tyreek Hill were to suffer an injury.. Kelce wasn't far off at 295 last year. If he can jump another 40 points, we'd be looking at the WR1 if he qualified for that possession. Kelce is absolutely worth a top 20 pick this year."
2 weeks ago
15. JuJu Smith-Schuster WR - PIT (at BAL)
"With Antonio Brown out of town, many will automatically assume that Smith-Schuster will get more targets. You shouldn't be so quick to jump aboard that train. He saw 166 targets in 2018, which ranked fourth in the league. On top of that, the Steelers threw the ball a league-high 687 times. On top of that, he'll now see a bit more shadow coverage from top cornerbacks, making life a tad difficult. He's still going to be the focal point of their pass-attack, making him worthy of a second-round pick"
3 weeks ago
16. Joe Mixon RB - CIN (vs . CLE)
"You have to love watching Marvin Lewis walk out the door if you're Mixon, as he was severely underused as a receiver in Lewis' offense. In comes Zac Taylor, who said he's going to start the Bengals playbook with the Rams offense, which is where he came from as a quarterbacks coach for Sean McVay. Them drafting two running backs is somewhat concerning, but that could be to protect them in case of a Mixon injury, which has happened a few times in his short career"
3 weeks ago
17. Tyreek Hill WR - KC (vs . LAC)
"Tyreek was not suspended but the NFL said if any new evidence surfaced, the case would be revisited for suspension so be aware of that caveat. It seems likely, however, that he will play the majority of the season and if he does, you can bet he'll finish top 10, and more likely top 5 even despite a few rough weeks mixed in."
3 weeks ago
18. Dalvin Cook RB - MIN (vs . CHI)
"We've still yet to see Cook stay healthy throughout an NFL season, but that's not stopping drafters from taking him with a pick inside the first two rounds. The Vikings are a high-powered offense who upgraded their offensive line this offseason, so the appeal is justified. The Vikings did draft Alexander Mattison in the third-round, so they're obviously concerned about the depth behind Cook, but he's the starter as long as he's healthy"
3 weeks ago
19. Todd Gurley RB - LAR (vs . ARI)
"There are some real questions surrounding Gurley as we enter the 2019 season. Not only did C.J. Anderson play over him during the playoffs, but the Rams also traded up to the start of the third-round to select Darrell Henderson, an explosive running back out of Memphis. The Rams also matched an offer sheet the Lions submitted to backup running back Malcolm Brown, meaning the Rams are more worried about Gurley than they're letting on. We all know Gurley comes with plenty of upside, but we also know you can't win your fantasy league in the first-round, but you can definitely help lose it."
2 weeks ago
20. Mike Evans WR - TB (vs . ATL)
"For years, it's been Evans' show in Tampa Bay, as he's averaged 148 targets over the last four years. He'll now be competing with Chris Godwin and O.J. Howard, who have carved out important roles in the offense. The arrival of Bruce Arians is a positive on the offense as a whole, but the running backs are going to score a lot more points than they did under Dirk Koetter. Evans is a relatively safe pick as a low-end WR1 but his ceiling may not be what it used to be"
3 weeks ago
21. George Kittle TE - SF (at SEA)
"You have to give Kittle a ton of credit for what he did in 2018. He played with a combination of Jimmy Garoppolo, C.J. Beathard, and Nick Mullens, yet managed to set the yardage record for a tight end. Getting Garoppolo back for the full season should help, but he may lose a few targets considering Dante Pettis is now in a starting role, while the 49ers drafted Deebo Samuel in the second-round and Jalen Hurd in the third-round. He's still a force to be reckoned with and one of the three tight ends worth a pick in the first three rounds"
3 weeks ago
22. Keenan Allen WR - LAC (at KC)
"With Tyrell Williams taking off to the Raiders, will Allen play on the perimeter much more, or do those targets go to Travis Benjamin? My guess is that he stays in the same role, though he might have a few more targets come his way. Throughout his time in the league, Allen has been a bit more up-and-down than fantasy owners would like, but his potential increase in targets could even that out a bit. He's a fine low-end WR1 if you go RB-heavy in the first two rounds"
3 weeks ago
23. Antonio Brown WR - OAK (at DEN)
"You can say what you want about Brown's attitude but he has one heck of a work ethic which has led to him being one of the all-time great receivers. Derek Carr is a rough draw for him, but Brown is still in the second-tier of WRs and likely to reach double-digit TDs for the 5th time in 6 seasons. It is also worth noting that his foot concern is not worth worrying about heading into the season."
1 week ago
24. T.Y. Hilton WR - IND (at JAC)
"It went from Hilton as the only show in town, to what looks like a full house. He'll now compete with Devin Funchess, Parris Campbell, Eric Ebron, Jack Doyle, and Nyheim Hines for targets, though the connection between him and Luck cannot be duplicated. Hilton had always been known as a boom or bust type receiver, but Frank Reich's arrival boosted his consistency, as he posted WR2 or better numbers in a career-high 64.3 percent of his games"
3 weeks ago
25. Zach Ertz TE - PHI (at NYG)
"With the new additions of DeSean Jackson, JJ Arcega-Whiteside, and Miles Sanders, you have to wonder if Ertz loses of his (tight end) record of 156 targets he saw in 2018. You also have Dallas Goedert coming into his second season after an impressive rookie campaign. Still, it's rare to find a tight end who can average 8-10 targets per game, making Ertz worthy of a pick in the top three rounds"
3 weeks ago
26. Melvin Gordon RB - LAC (at KC)
"Prior to the holdout becoming a realistic possibility, Gordon was locked into the top 6 picks. At this point, however, he i falling out of even the second round in most cases and that may further plummet if the holdout extends into the preseason. He doesn't have much to lose by holding out but if the Chargers realize their window to win is closing, chances are that he'll be signed well before your fantasy draft."
6 days ago
27. Kerryon Johnson RB - DET (vs . GB)
"Kerryon is a popular mid-round pick this year for many and while he may be talented, this offense is unlikely to produce enough points to give him much of a ceiling. What's more, is that Kerryon himself has said he isn't a three-down back so his touches will be more limited than the names being drafted above him in the 4th and 5th round."
6 days ago
28. Amari Cooper WR - DAL (vs . WAS)
"It was good to see Cooper go to Dallas and get consistent targets, as that's something he was missing throughout his time in Oakland. He saw at least five targets in each of his nine games with the Cowboys, while seeing seven or more targets in 7-of-9 games. Because of that, he finished as the No. 4 wide receiver in fantasy from the time he joined them, behind only Antonio Brown, Davante Adams, and Julio Jones. He may not offer the consistency that those guys do, but not many do. Cooper should be on the low-end WR1 radar"
3 weeks ago
29. Stefon Diggs WR - MIN (vs . CHI)
"It's been quite the career arc for Diggs, who has gone from the WR46 his rookie year, to the WR30, WR19, and then WR10 in 2018 while collecting a career-high 150 targets. That's important, as it shows his new quarterback Kirk Cousins trusts him. With Adam Thielen around, it'll be tough for him to break into the top-five, but Diggs should be considered a relatively safe low-end WR1 in fantasy circles who would have top-five upside should something happen to Thielen"
3 weeks ago
30. Adam Thielen WR - MIN (vs . CHI)
"Even though his teammate Diggs managed over 100 receptions, Thielen posted 113 to go with a career-high 1,373 yards and 9 scores. There is room for both of them to finish as top 12 fantasy wideouts seeing that the rest of the receiver corps is barren. Their upside is limited, however, unless one goes down with an injury."
2 days ago
31. Marlon Mack RB - IND (at JAC)
"Mack was given 20+ touches more often than any running back in football not named Zeke last season. Most take that to mean he has bonkers upside, especially considering the incredible offense he plays in which features the best offensive line in the game. The fact of the matter, however, is that Mack's target share is too low for top 5 RB upside unless Nyheim Hines suddenly goes away. Even so, he is a safe bet to finish in the top 24 RBs."
6 days ago
32. Patrick Mahomes QB - KC (vs . LAC)
"Yes, Mahomes is coming off the best fantasy season of all-time for a quarterback. Yes, he's going to have some regression. He threw a touchdown on 8.6 percent of his passes in 2018, the seventh-highest mark of all-time. Here's the list of quarterbacks who are ahead of them, included with their touchdown rate in that season, as well as the following season: Peyton Manning (9.9 to 6.2), Ken Stabler (9.3 to 6.8), Deshaun Watson (9.3 to 5.1), Aaron Rodgers (9.0 to 7.1), Tom Brady (8.7 to 5.0), Mark Rypien (8.7 to 4.6). Don't pay for last year's stats"
3 weeks ago
33. Devonta Freeman RB - ATL (at TB)
"Do you remember Freeman's rookie year? Probably not, because it had him falling outside the top 35 running backs selected the following year. In that season, he totaled just 248 yards and one touchdown on 65 carries. That's significant because that's the only year he played under Dirk Koetter, who is now back in Atlanta as the coordinator. While Freeman will have a much bigger role, Koetter hasn't been able to boost a run-game during his time in Atlanta or Tampa Bay, so the ceiling has likely dropped for Freeman. And that's not to mention Ito Smith, whose role grew as the year went on in 2018"
3 weeks ago
34. Damien Williams RB - KC (vs . LAC)
"Williams entered 2018 with virtually no production to his name but exploded when given the opportunity in Andy Reid's offense. So long as he can get healthy and earn his spot as the starter, he will be a top 20 running back with room for much more. That upside will depend entirely on his large of a role he can handle, as the offense is certain to score plenty of points, plus Andy Reid is talking up Carlos Hyde."
6 days ago
35. Leonard Fournette RB - JAC (vs . IND)
"Everyone remembers what they saw last, which is why Fournette is dropping down draft boards. The last time fantasy owners saw him play, he totaled just 126 rushing yards and one touchdown over his last three games. What they don't know is that the Jaguars offensive line was missing 4-of-5 starters at the end of the year. Fournette is locked into 20 touches per week, which is extremely odd to find at the start of the third-round, which is where you can get him 90 percent of the time"
3 weeks ago
36. Julian Edelman WR - NE (vs . MIA)
"There are not nearly as many familiar faces for Tom Brady to look at nowadays, but Edelman remains as his favorite target. With Rob Gronkowski ailing last year, Edelman stepped up and finished as a WR2 or better in 75 percent of his games, a new career-high. With Gronkowski and Chris Hogan gone, Edelman's role isn't going to shrink in 2019. He's a sturdy WR2 presence"
3 weeks ago
37. Brandin Cooks WR - LAR (vs . ARI)
"Most wouldn't believe it, but 2018 was Cooks' most consistent season from a fantasy standpoint. That's impressive considering it was his first year in the offense, while the other receivers had more experience. He finished as a WR2 or better in 53.3 percent of his games, which ranked 14th among wide receivers. With Cooper Kupp and Robert Woods getting theirs, it'll be hard for Cooks to get into elite territory, but knowing he was this consistent should give drafters confidence in taking him as a high-end WR2"
3 weeks ago
38. Aaron Jones RB - GB (at DET)
"While on the field, Jones was an elusive as any runner in the NFL. The issue, of course, was that Green Bay refused to use him like the three-down machine he can be. That may change with a new coach in town, but until we are certain he is a 300 touch guy, he will likely fall to the third round. Don't mistake that for meaning he doesn't have top 5 RB upside, however, because he most certainly does."
6 days ago
39. Robert Woods WR - LAR (vs . ARI)
"It required at least 11.7 PPR points to finish as a WR3 or better in 2018. That's a number Woods hit in 87.5 percent of his games. The wide receivers who did it more? Davante Adams, DeAndre Hopkins, and Antonio Brown. That's it. He doesn't offer the upside of the top-tier guys, but as a steady, consistent WR2 in your lineup, Woods gets the job done"
3 weeks ago
40. Kenny Golladay WR - DET (vs . GB)
"It's clear that the Lions view Golladay as their long-term WR1, though you do have to wonder just how high his ceiling will be. Despite Golden Tate leaving and Marvin Jones missing time at the end of the season, Golladay finished as the No. 21 receiver in fantasy. When drafting him as your WR2, understand that he may not have the upside or consistency of guys like Stefon Diggs and Brandin Cooks"
3 weeks ago
41. Chris Godwin WR - TB (vs . ATL)
"The hype on Godwin has reached its peak, as he's expected to make a splash in Bruce Arians' new offense. With Mike Evans stealing quite a large share of the targets, you have to wonder just how high the ceiling is for Godwin, as the Bucs are likely going to run the ball a bit more under Arians. Godwin is a rock-solid player, but you mustn't forget that he's the No. 2 receiver on his team, and there's also a tight end (O.J. Howard) who deserves a lot of targets by his own right. It's okay to like Godwin in 2019, but keep expectations in check"
3 weeks ago
42. Derrick Henry RB - TEN (at HOU)
"Henry is currently dealing with a strained calf muscle so this will be something to keep an eye on. After the way he performed to close out the season, there is no doubting that Tennessee will actually use Henry as the primary back all season, however. He might lead the league in rushing yards, as he can be a workhorse, but without much help on offense, the touchdowns probably won't accompany the yards, nor will any receiving production, limiting his fantasy ceiling substantially."
2 weeks ago
43. Chris Carson RB - SEA (vs . SF)
"Carson is the ultimate boom or bust running back this season. Seattle may very well lead the league in carries again this season and Carson is about as efficient as they come. The concern, however, is that his knee will allow Penny to pass him on the depth chart. If that happens, Carson will still be a solid flex play, but if Carson holds onto the starting job, don't be shocked if he finishes top 10 or perhaps even higher this year."
6 days ago
44. Tyler Lockett WR - SEA (vs . SF)
"The loss of Doug Baldwin will surely open up some targets for Lockett, and the best part is that they'll come where he's most effective. Lockett has posted the third-best numbers in the league from the slot over the last two years, behind only Tyreek Hill and A.J. Green. In the games that Baldwin missed all/most of in 2018, Lockett played in the slot on 59.4 percent of his snaps. His efficiency will have a hard time remaining as high as it was in 2018, but his increased snaps in the slot can help make up for it"
3 weeks ago
45. Josh Jacobs RB - OAK (at DEN)
"Any time you have a running back drafted inside the first-round of the NFL Draft, you'd better consider him in fantasy football. Why? Over the last six years, first-round running backs have averaged 283.4 touches in their rookie season. While the Raiders aren't likely to be a high-scoring offense, they should be improved significantly with the talent they've added on offense. Jacobs should be a low-end RB2, at worst"
3 weeks ago
46. Cooper Kupp WR - LAR (vs . ARI)
"Kupp is not going to begin the season on the PUP but that doesn't mean he won't end up sitting to start the season. The fact of the matter is that it hasn't been all that long since his major injury, and like Allen Robinson showed last year, optimism in these cases can be a dangerous game."
6 days ago
47. David Montgomery RB - CHI (at MIN)
"It's clear the Bears didn't think Jordan Howard fit into their offensive scheme after sending him away for a sixth-round pick, right? So, what does that say about Montgomery, who they traded up into the third-round to get? Howard finished as the RB20 in his first season under Matt Nagy. Montgomery was likely the best pure runner in the draft who's already shown the ability to handle a workhorse role, and offers more in the passing-game than Howard did, though most of that work will go to Tarik Cohen. Montgomery was drafted on a team that's built to win right now, which means he'll have big value immediately"
3 weeks ago
48. Tyler Boyd WR - CIN (vs . CLE)
"Boyd just signed a four-year extension with the Bengals which means Zac Taylor must have big plans for him. A.J. Green is still the number one and will be back within a handful of weeks and Andy Dalton can only create so many fantasy points, but Boyd is a strong bet to finish as a WR3."
1 week ago
49. Deshaun Watson QB - HOU (vs . TEN)
"Despite dealing with a chest injury that hampered his rushing ability in the middle of the season, then losing both Will Fuller and Keke Coutee for portions of the season, Watson finished as the QB4, ahead of Andrew Luck. Now bring back a healthy Fuller and Coutee alongside DeAndre Hopkins with a healthy Watson, and you might have yourself a contender for the QB1 in 2019"
3 weeks ago
50. Alshon Jeffery WR - PHI (at NYG)
"Did you know Jeffery finished as the WR20 in his first season with the Eagles, and then finished as the WR26 in 2018 despite missing three full games? He's not an exciting pick, but he's proven production when in the lineup. It surely won't hurt that Carson Wentz should be back and healthy, as he posted better numbers with him than with Nick Foles"
3 weeks ago
51. Calvin Ridley WR - ATL (at TB)
"It's not often we see a rookie wide receiver make an impact in fantasy football the way Ridley did, especially when there's a stud wide receiver on the other side of the field like Julio Jones. Despite that, Ridley popped-off for 821 yards and 10 touchdowns, finishing as the WR20. While some would expect him to build on that, the Falcons aren't likely to throw the ball as much as they did in 2018 due to their defensive stars being healthy again. He should offer a bit more consistency, though, and if something were to happen to Jones, he'd immediately be a top-15 play every week"
3 weeks ago
52. Sony Michel RB - NE (vs . MIA)
"It was a solid rookie year for Michel, who finished as the RB28 despite missing three full games. The issue with expecting a massive jump in production is his lack of usage in the passing game (just 7 receptions in 13 games), and the third-round draft pick of Damien Harris, as he's a threat to steal some early-down work. Still, Michel should provide RB2 value as long as he's healthy"
3 weeks ago
53. Aaron Rodgers QB - GB (at DET)
"Rodgers finished as the No. 6 quarterback in fantasy last year despite throwing just 25 touchdowns. Did you know that was the first time in his career where he's played more than 10 games and failed to finish as a top-two fantasy quarterback? That track record is rather impossible to beat, even if Patrick Mahomes is coming off the best fantasy season of all-time. Don't reach for a quarterback with all the options available this year, but if Rodgers were to fall to the late-fourth or early-fifth-round, you should absolutely pull the trigger"
3 weeks ago
54. D.J. Moore WR - CAR (vs . NO)
"Moore became a full-time player for the Panthers in Week 8, so we've already seen a glimpse of what he can offer. But how high is his consistency and what players was he comparable to once he did take over that starting job? His teammate Curtis Samuel saw nearly the same target share in those weeks and actually offered more constant production. Moore is the superior player, but he'll also see more top-tier cornerbacks than Samuel will. With Cam Newton's hit-or-miss accuracy, Moore will definitely have some duds thrown in, which is why he's best-suited as a WR3 on your fantasy team"
3 weeks ago
55. Mark Ingram RB - BAL (vs . PIT)
"Leaving the nest of the Saints offense is something Ingram has never had to do, so life may seem a bit more difficult in Baltimore. It's a good thing that they'll be a run-first team with Lamar Jackson under center, but it's also a bad thing around the goal-line, as Jackson is more of a threat to score than Ingram. The Ravens drafted Justice Hill, and still have Kenneth Dixon and Gus Edwards on the roster, so it may be more of a timeshare than some believe, though Ingram should be the leader in the clubhouse. His lack of upside drops him below some of the other options in his range"
3 weeks ago
56. O.J. Howard TE - TB (vs . ATL)
"O.J. Howard's 11.8 yards per target in 2018 ranks as the second-highest mark of all-time among tight ends who saw at least 40 targets. His mark of 11.1 yards per target in 2017 would rank fifth all-time, but he just missed the cutoff with 39 targets. His career mark of 11.5 yards per target is the best of all-time (since they started tracking targets). In short, he's a rock-solid presence when healthy, but he needs to stay on the field"
3 weeks ago
57. Allen Robinson WR - CHI (at MIN)
"It's tough to know how you should value Robinson, as he was coming off a torn ACL in 2018, joining a new team with a new quarterback, and learning a new offense. With that being said, he'll likely be a bit more inconsistent than he was in Jacksonville due to the number of weapons the Bears have available. Between him, Anthony Miller, Taylor Gabriel, Trey Burton, Tarik Cohen, and David Montgomery, you may be stuck with some lackluster weeks, which is not something you want out of your WR2, meaning he's best-suited as a WR3 who'll give you some WR1 performances at times"

58. Mike Williams WR - LAC (at KC)
"There have been just 16 wide receivers who've been able to finish as a top-20 fantasy receiver with less than 100 targets over the last 10 years. Williams just did it with 66 targets, while Tyler Lockett did it with 71 targets in 2018. No other wide receivers can say they did it with less than 79 targets. The exit of Tyrell Williams in free agency means a lot more targets and consistency is in store for Mike Williams in 2019. It's rare to find a wide receiver being drafted outside the top-25 wide receivers with top-10 upside, but Williams has it"

59. A.J. Green WR - CIN (vs . CLE)
"Green is out for 1 to 3 weeks after an ankle injury so his stock has dropped. When he returns, though, can someone explain why everyone suddenly stopped believing Green to be a second-tier fantasy receiver. Every time he has played 16 games, Green has finished among the top 10 fantasy receivers. Sure, there have been two injuries in the last three seasons, but he was still dominant up until those. If you pro-rate his 2018 numbers out to a full season, we were looking at a pace of 90 receptions, 1,374 yards and 12 scores. Friends, that would have placed him sixth among wide receivers in fantasy scoring, just between Julio Jones and Michael Thomas."

60. Phillip Lindsay RB - DEN (vs . OAK)
"It's pretty rare to see a running back who finished top-12 his rookie season despite missing a game fall down draft boards the following year, especially when the team didn't add another running back. That's precisely the case with Lindsay, who will share some touches with Royce Freeman, but Lindsay has proven to be much more capable in the pass-game than Freeman, which gives him the nod as the starter. While there is some built-in risk, it's not enough to knock Lindsay out of solid RB2 territory"
3 weeks ago
61. Evan Engram TE - NYG (vs . PHI)
"Remember when Engram finished his rookie season as the No. 5 tight end? Well, he did that because the volume was there. He saw 115 targets that season because of the injuries to Odell Beckham and Brandon Marshall. Those guys are both gone, and while Sterling Shepard and Golden Tate remain, those guys aren't going to see the target share of Beckham. Not only did Engram's target-share dip last year, but he also dealt with some injuries, leading him to finish outside the top-10 in his sophomore season. The expectation should be that he'll see 100-plus targets in 2019, which is something only 4-5 tight ends can say"
3 weeks ago
62. Jarvis Landry WR - CLE (at CIN)
"Despite no Josh Gordon and no Odell Beckham Jr. on the team last year, Landry finished as the WR19 despite playing all 16 games and seeing 149 targets. That was the eighth-most targets among receivers and the 27th-most points per game. Not exactly efficient, and Freddie Kitchens actually dialed back his targets when he took over. With Beckham in the mix, look for Landry to move down into the 120-target range, which is still valuable, but he's more of a WR3 than he is a WR2"
3 weeks ago
63. Hunter Henry TE - LAC (at KC)
"Prior to tearing his ACL, Henry's career arc was moving in the right direction. His per-target production is through the roof, as he's seen 115 targets in his career that have amounted to 81 receptions for 1,057 yards and 12 touchdowns. By comparison, Zach Ertz saw 156 targets in 2018 and finished with 1,163 yards and 8 touchdowns"
3 weeks ago
64. Robby Anderson WR - NYJ (at BUF)
"If you are drafting Anderson because you believe Sam Darnold is going to breakout, you may want to be more prudent. If it is because this receiver corps is horrendous, now that's another story. Anderson is a lock to see 100 targets and commonly notches 14+ yards per catch so he is a strong flex play or even WR3."
2 days ago
65. James White RB - NE (vs . MIA)
"How are we devaluing White's role on the Patriots again? With Rob Gronkowski, Cordarrelle Patterson, and Chris Hogan gone, Tom Brady is going to be looking for some familiar faces and it's not like they've used Sony Michel in the passing game. White should have a similar role to last year, you know, the one that had him wind-up as the RB8 on the season. We're all still probably too low on him"
3 weeks ago
66. Andrew Luck QB - IND (at JAC)
"Luck has now been a top-five fantasy quarterback in all four healthy seasons of his career. Last year, he accomplished it despite having a terrible receiving corps, which has since seen significant upgrades., It isn't a stretch to put his ceiling at 5,000 yards and 45 touchdowns this year, which would obviously make him the top fantasy QB. With that said, the potential to re-injure to the shoulder also gives him a low floor. The calf injury doesn't appear to be anything serious enough to influence your rankings for now."
2 days ago
67. Baker Mayfield QB - CLE (at CIN)
"Mayfield was extraordinarily impressive as a rookie, breaking the TD record in just 12 starts and without much talent in his receiving corps. Even still, the landscape of the game has it that he was only tied for 12th in fantasy points and behind both Dak Prescott and Mitch Trubisky. While Baker is underrated in the running game and adds Odell Beckham, it may be premature to assume he will leap into the top five."
2 days ago
68. Tevin Coleman RB - SF (at SEA)
"This 49ers offense is so difficult to figure out. We know they will succeed in running the ball since Shanahan is pulling the strings, but who the primary back will be, if there is one at all, is anyone's guess. Coleman does come with substantial upside and is currently the starter but there is much more risk than anyone else in the top 30 RBs."
1 week ago
69. Matt Ryan QB - ATL (at TB)
"Ryan is not as sexy to own as Mahomes or Rodgers, but he certainly has gotten the job done over the last three seasons. In that time, no fantasy football player has more fantasy points, and with a reasonable 5.6% TD-rate, that pace appears to be sustainable. It further helps that he may have the best receiving corps in football."
2 days ago
70. Sammy Watkins WR - KC (vs . LAC)
"Here's your risk/reward player in the 4/5-round range, as Watkins presents solid WR3 marks with Tyreek Hill in the lineup, but presents top-12 upside if Hill were to be suspended and/or miss time. Watkins also comes with health risks, as his foot injury acted up again in 2018, meaning this is a chronic injury that can resurface at any point. You know the risk, but you also know the potential reward. If drafting him, surround him with a few safer players on your roster"
3 weeks ago
71. Corey Davis WR - TEN (at HOU)
"It's been a brutal start to Davis' career as someone who was supposed to be in the conversation of top-15 receivers entering year-three of his career. Instead, many are wondering whether he'll be able to deliver top-30 numbers now that they drafted A.J. Brown and spent some serious money on Adam Humphries. It was tough for Marcus Mariota to support a consistent wide receiver with the talent they had and it's unlikely that this makes it easier on the talented Davis who was a WR3 or better in just 37.5 percent of his games last year"
3 weeks ago
72. Christian Kirk WR - ARI (at LAR)
"On a team with not much fantasy appeal, Kirk made a splash his rookie year, totaling 590 yards and three touchdowns on just 68 targets. Under new head coach Kliff Kingsbury, the Cardinals are going to be four-wide a lot, which will allow Kirk to get more time in the slot, opposite Larry Fitzgerald, which is where most thought he'd wind up. If Kyler Murray lives up to the hype, Kirk just might be a fantasy starter, and has the chance to overtake Fitzgerald as the top option on the Cardinals"
3 weeks ago
73. Lamar Miller RB - HOU (vs . TEN)
"It may not excite anyone to pick Miller but he falls to you as your RB3, you should be pleased. He is an RB2 every season and if the offensive line has finally improved, he has upside for more, assuming he and Watson can both stay on the field. The Duke Johnson trade does limit his three-down upside, however."
6 days ago
74. Will Fuller WR - HOU (vs . TEN)
"Fuller will be coming off an ACL tear in 2019, though that's not as daunting as it once was. During his career, he's been a different player with/without Deshaun Watson, as he's averaged 4.1 receptions for 71.1 yards and 1.0 touchdowns per game with Watson, compared to just 3.1 receptions for 38.7 yards, and 0.1 touchdowns per game without him. The addition of Keke Coutee is going to eat into his target share, but Fuller was always somewhat of a big-play threat who needed to get it done on limited targets. That won't change in 2019"
3 weeks ago
75. Tarik Cohen RB - CHI (at MIN)
"We all believed Cohen was underused in John Fox's offense, and while he did finish as a top-15 running back in PPR last year, his touches didn't increase all that much under Matt Nagy. He finished the year with 20 more targets and 12 more rush attempts, which definitely helps, but the additions of David Montgomery and Mike Davis aren't going to help him add much to that number, so he'll have to remain ultra-efficient. Think of Cohen as a younger James White who may not see as many targets, but will get more carries"
3 weeks ago
76. Marvin Jones WR - DET (vs . GB)
"It's surprising to see Jones fall as far as he is in drafts this year, as he was a solid presence in fantasy lineups when healthy last year. He posted WR2 or better numbers 33.3 percent of the time, which ranked 30th among receivers, and a lot of the games he played was with Golden Tate on the field. When you have a wide receiver post at least 54 yards in 7-of-9 games, he's worth WR3 consideration"
3 weeks ago
77. Kenyan Drake RB - MIA (at NE)
"With a new offense, it is anyone's guess how large of a workload Drake will be given. Frank Gore is out of the equation so perhaps Drake will take over as a true three-down back. That could be fire if Ryan Fitzpatrick wins the starting job, but if it is Rosen, there won't be much upside in the Miami running game. Just recently, it has been Kalen Ballage who is running with the first team so this is a situation to monitor."
2 weeks ago
78. Latavius Murray RB - NO (at CAR)
"If Murray lands in the old Mark Ingram role, everyone is too low on him, as he'll offer RB2 numbers more often than not. It's hard to imagine that someone just walks in and fills Ingram's shoes, but the Saints didn't waste any time locking Murray up in free agency, so they clearly viewed him as someone who could do it. You might want to expect a slight bump in touches for Alvin Kamara, while Murray gets slightly less than Ingram did. He's going to be a bit touchdown-dependent, but he's able to fill the RB3 slot on your fantasy team"
3 weeks ago
79. Curtis Samuel WR - CAR (vs . NO)
"His teammate D.J. Moore is the favorite among the fantasy community, but Samuel actually performed better than him last year. Despite playing in just 12 games, Samuel hit WR2-type numbers in four games, while Moore hit that mark just three times while playing all 16 games. He may not have the consistent floor that Moore does, but he can help fill a few bye weeks if needed"
3 weeks ago
80. Cam Newton QB - CAR (vs . NO)
"Cam is expected back for Week 1 and he was quite good before the issue last season so he may be undervalued at this point. His legs, and especially in the end zone, make him a lock to be a top 10 performer while he is on the field, and perhaps as high as top 3 as we've seen from Cam numerous times."
1 week ago
81. Dante Pettis WR - SF (at SEA)
"He didn't start for the 49ers right away, which was somewhat puzzling, but when Pettis got onto the field, he flashed a bit. It was Week 10 when Pettis turned into a full-time player, and from then until Week 16, he was the No. 20 wide receiver in fantasy, with Nick Mullens as his quarterback. The 49ers did add Deebo Samuel in the draft, but as we saw with Pettis, there's no guarantee he'll be a starter right away. Even if so, Jimmy Garoppolo returning to the lineup should only help his consistency in fantasy lineups"
3 weeks ago
82. Carson Wentz QB - PHI (at NYG)
"If you were to put Wentz's numbers up against the career of this decade's fantasy starters, his closest comparison would be Tony Romo. During his career, Romo posted QB1-type numbers 45 percent of the time, which is precisely what Wentz has done in his three years. Wentz hasn't offered the upside that some of the quarterbacks above him in the rankings, but he should provide high-end QB2-type production at year's end"
3 weeks ago
83. Jared Cook TE - NO (at CAR)
"Recency bias is real with Cook, who has been a disappointment throughout his fantasy career. Sure, he's going to play with Drew Brees in New Orleans, but don't forget that he played with Aaron Rodgers just a few short years ago. Did you know that 2018 was the first time he scored more than five touchdowns in a season? Or how about that it was his first time topping 54 receptions or 759 yards? Over the last three years there hasn't been a running back/tight end duo who's topped 195 targets on the same team (the highest duo on the Saints has been just 151). Over the last two years, Kamara has totaled at least 100 targets, which tells you that Cook's ceiling is extremely limited"
3 weeks ago
84. Sterling Shepard WR - NYG (vs . PHI)
"There are many excited for Shepard's potential with Odell Beckham off to Cleveland. While his target potential has definitely improved, his role must now change, especially with Golden Tate being signed to seemingly take over the slot role that Shepard has occupied for the last few seasons. When playing on the perimeter, Shepard has seen 62 targets over the last two years and hasn't scored a touchdown. If you're drafting him, it's due to his increase in volume, because his efficiency will take a hit. You also need to know that he suffered a broken thumb during the first few days of training camp and is unlikely to play at all in the preseason. They're expecting him to be ready for Week 1, but it's something to monitor."
2 weeks ago
85. Rashaad Penny RB - SEA (vs . SF)
"It wasn't the rookie season that many expected out of Penny, who was drafted in the first-round by the Seahawks, but 2019 is looking up. Not only did the Seahawks let Mike Davis walk in free agency (he received 146 touches last year), but Chris Carson had some work done on his knee. The Seahawks are clearly a run-first team, meaning it's possible we see both Carson and Penny fantasy relevant. Worst case scenario, you have what might be the best handcuff in football"
3 weeks ago
86. Russell Wilson QB - SEA (vs . SF)
"The change in offense really hurt Wilson's potential in 2018 and you have to wonder if it'll be the same in 2019. After seeing his pass attempts rise every year in the league, Wilson saw them dip down to just 427 of them in 2018. Losing Doug Baldwin surely won't help, though the addition of D.K. Metcalf won't hurt. Wilson is likely a lock to finish top-10 at his position, but his upside has diminished greatly"
3 weeks ago
87. Dede Westbrook WR - JAC (vs . IND)
"It's quite shocking to see the consensus has Westbrook as a borderline WR3 and that they would take him over Larry Fitzgerald in a redraft format. Do you believe that Nick Foles improves the pass-catchers' stock in Jacksonville? Tough to argue that point. To this point in his career, Westbrook has posted WR2 or better numbers in just 26.1 percent of his games, which is comparable to Kendall Wright's career numbers"
3 weeks ago
88. Larry Fitzgerald WR - ARI (at LAR)
"Fitzgerald is just one year removed from posting top 10 fantasy wide receiver numbers and while that is no longer a possibility, he seems like a lock to end up in the top 40 again, thanks in part to a new up-tempo offense."
3 weeks ago
89. Derrius Guice RB - WAS (at DAL)
"There are a lot of questions surrounding Guice's health right now, as he's said to be doing well in his rehab, but everything the Redskins are doing screams he's not. They re-signed Adrian Peterson to a two-year deal, still have Chris Thompson, and then drafted Bryce Love at the top of the fourth-round. He's someone who can move up draft boards if we're able to see him in the preseason, but this backfield is starting to look like a messy timeshare"
3 weeks ago
90. Eric Ebron TE - IND (at JAC)
"You don't need us to tell you that Ebron's going to come back down to earth in 2019, right? Let's say you're optimistic and aren't worried about the additions of Devin Funchess and Parris Campbell, or the return of Jack Doyle. He scored 14 touchdowns in 2018, which ranks as the third-most all-time by a tight end. His targets (110), however, ranked 13th all-time, and his yardage (750) ranked 132nd all-time. Regression is coming"
3 weeks ago
91. Drew Brees QB - NO (at CAR)
"The Saints aren't going to be the crazy pass-heavy offense they were in years past, but that doesn't mean Brees isn't usable in fantasy. After lacking upside in 2017 when he failed to post more than 22 fantasy points, he bounced back in 2018 and had six such games. The defense might hold him back from being an elite fantasy option, but he's a very safe low-end QB1 with a relatively high floor"
3 weeks ago
92. Vance McDonald TE - PIT (at BAL)
"With Antonio Brown and Jesse James out of town, there's over 200 targets up for grabs in the Steelers offense, though they're not likely to throw the ball as much in 2019. Still, McDonald was given a vote of confidence when the Steelers didn't draft a tight end in the first four rounds of what was considered a deep tight end class. Not much slides past me, but did you know McDonald saw 73 targets in 2018? That ranked 12th among tight ends and he finished as the No. 10 fantasy tight end. If McDonald stays on the field, he's absolutely locked-in for 90-plus targets and a top-eight finish in 2019"
3 weeks ago
93. Courtland Sutton WR - DEN (vs . OAK)
"Despite starting for much of the season and finishing with 84 targets, Sutton failed to capitalize on them in his rookie season. He finished with just over 700 yards, which isn't horrible, but he now has a quarterback (Joe Flacco) who hasn't supported consistency out of wide receivers his entire career. On top of that, the Broncos moved to a defense-first head coach who'll want to run the ball a bit more often. It's tough to see Sutton overcoming some of these obstacles and breaking out in 2019"
3 weeks ago
94. Jared Goff QB - LAR (vs . ARI)
"There's some who believe Goff will struggle with Todd Gurley moving into more of a timeshare role, but that's unlikely to be the case. Those who say that will point to last year's finish, but Goff struggled prior to Gurley leaving the lineup, as he was in some sort of funk after their bye week (likely due to Cooper Kupp missing). Still, under Sean McVay, Goff has been a top-12 type performer in 14-of-31 games (45.2 percent), which may not sound like much, but it would rank 11th among quarterbacks the last two years. He's a low-end QB1/high-end QB2 who might see an increase in pass attempts this year"
3 weeks ago
95. Austin Ekeler RB - LAC (at KC)
"We've essentially got two different fantasy assets here as Ekeler's relevance will depend entirely on the Melvin Gordon holdout. If Gordon plays, Ekeler is an RB4 depth piece to fill in during bye weeks and in case of injuries. If Gordon sits, Ekeler jumps clean into the top 25 fantasy RBs immediately."
1 week ago
96. David Njoku TE - CLE (at CIN)
"It's hard looking on the bright side if you're a Njoku supporter, as he had the opportunity of a lifetime last year when Josh Gordon was traded. It allowed him to see much more targets in the offense with Baker Mayfield, though it didn't turn into what many had hoped. He ranked seventh in targets (89), but ninth in fantasy scoring. The addition of Odell Beckham surely isn't going to help him add to that target total, so he'll need to get more efficient in order to take the next step"
3 weeks ago
97. Miles Sanders RB - PHI (at NYG)
"There are many who believe Sanders' three-down skill-set will make Doug Pederson change his ways, though you shouldn't be so sure about that. During his three years in Philadelphia, there has been just one running back who has topped 42 snaps in a game, and that was Darren Sproles, who is more of a scat-back than a traditional one. They also traded for Jordan Howard, who is likely to steal some goal-line work, as he was really good in that role with the Bears. Sanders is likely to end the year as a top-25 fantasy running back, but it'll likely be a bumpy road, similar to how it was with Jay Ajayi"
3 weeks ago
98. Royce Freeman RB - DEN (vs . OAK)
"There are many who've written off Freeman as just a backup, while others are expecting his talent to shine through and earn a bigger role under the new coaching staff. The issue is that Phillip Lindsay is a better pass-catcher, which means he isn't going away. Still, Freeman will have a role in the offense, even if it's in a timeshare. He can deliver low-end flex numbers with RB2 upside if something were to happen to Lindsay"
3 weeks ago
99. Jameis Winston QB - TB (vs . ATL)
"With Fitzpatrick gone, Winston is no longer at risk of surrendering games to the backup. He may not be great in real life, but from a fantasy standpoint, this gunslinger piles up the points. In fact, he and Ryan Fitzpatrick last year combined for the 2nd most fantasy points in football. With one of the top receiving corps in football, Winston could potentially eclipse 4,800 yards with the touchdowns to put him in the top 3."
2 days ago
100. Jordan Howard RB - PHI (at NYG)
"If you've been hibernating since the end of the football season, you may have missed Howard being traded to the Eagles for a measly sixth-round pick. While some saw this as a value, Howard is an afterthought now that the Eagles spent a second-round pick on Miles Sanders, the more complete running back. Doug Pederson has allowed one running back to play more than 42 snaps in a game during his three years in Philadelphia: Darren Sproles, a do-it-all running back. Howard topped that number five times while with the Bears in 2018 alone with absolutely zero competition for the early-down role. He's more likely to be on waiver wires than he is returning to stud status"
3 weeks ago
101. Geronimo Allison WR - GB (at DET)
"The more we hear about the Packers receiver corps, the more it seems like Allison will be starting opposite Davante Adams. Many have already forgotten that Allison was the No. 26 wide receiver in fantasy for the first quarter of the season before suffering a season-ending injury. If Allison is the clear-cut starter, he belongs in the WR3/4 conversation"
3 weeks ago
102. Kyler Murray QB - ARI (at LAR)
"Murray has some big questions to be answered on whether he'll be in the league for a long time, but fortunately, as a fantasy player, you don't have to worry about it in 2019. He'll be the starter as long as he's healthy and with Kliff Kingsbury wanting to run 70-plus plays per game, it'll create plenty of fantasy points. The disparity in fantasy points per dropback isn't that large, so the more often he does it, the better, especially knowing he can rush for 500-plus yards. If Murray can stay on the field for all 16 games, he should be locked-in as a top-12 quarterback"
3 weeks ago
103. Anthony Miller WR - CHI (at MIN)
"It was a somewhat rough year for Miller in 2018, as most don't realize he had a Jones fracture in his foot prior to the NFL Draft, which was why he didn't participate in the Combine. He then went on to play through a separated shoulder his rookie season, yet proceeded to score seven touchdowns on just 54 targets. Miller seemingly has a knack for the end zone, as he scored 33 touchdowns in his final 26 games at Memphis. He did have shoulder surgery this offseason, but he is expected to be ready for the start of training camp. Knowing how well he played through injuries, you must wonder what he can do when healthy while playing the slot in Matt Nagy's offense"
3 weeks ago
104. Austin Hooper TE - ATL (at TB)
"It may have been the quietest top-six tight end finish of all time for Hooper last year, but that's where he was at. Now, his totals were inflated due to more passing than the Falcons wanted to do last year, as their defense was in shambles, forcing them to air it out against opponents. Hooper saw what was a career-high 88 targets because of that. With Calvin Ridley entering his second year, he figures to be more involved as well. Despite his top-six finish, Hooper posted top-12 type numbers just 37.5 percent of the time, which was tied with Jimmy Graham, and Trey Burton for 13th among tight ends, so there were some big performances to help him get there, and not so much consistency"
3 weeks ago
105. Ben Roethlisberger QB - PIT (at BAL)
"Losing Antonio Brown won't do Roethlisberger any favors and it's not as if he was a lock to finish top-10 before then. In fact, Roethlisberger has finished inside the top 10 quarterbacks just four times in his 15-year career. You thought he had ups and downs before? He's not worth the headache and we're surprised many experts are willing to invest a top-12 quarterback selection on him"
3 weeks ago
106. Lamar Jackson QB - BAL (vs . PIT)
"Did you know that Jackson set the record for most rushing attempts by a quarterback in one season despite not taking the starting job until Week 11? That's going to provide a fantasy floor that you cannot find late in drafts. If you miss out on one of the high-tier quarterbacks you were aiming for, Jackson can help provide a stable floor while your stud running backs and wide receivers take care of the rest (because you took them instead of a quarterback in the higher rounds). From Week 11 forward, Jackson was the QB8 in fantasy, right in between Andrew Luck and Russell Wilson. If he develops more as a passer, his ceiling only gets higher"
3 weeks ago
107. Darrell Henderson RB - LAR (vs . ARI)
"Are there concerns with Todd Gurley? Yes, but let's not pretend he's no longer on the team. Henderson takes the place of John Kelly, who was drafted last year to fill this role. Some have suggested the Rams love Henderson, but a third-round pick doesn't scream ""love him."" Whatever the case, Henderson would likely share backup duties with Malcolm Brown should something cause Gurley to miss time. Henderson does offer much more upside than Brown as the superior pass-catcher"
3 weeks ago
108. Dak Prescott QB - DAL (vs . WAS)
"If you were to tell someone that Prescott has had a nearly identical fantasy career as Drew Brees, what do you think they'd say? While it's just a three-year sample size, Prescott has posted top-five type numbers in 22.9 percent of his games, while Brees is at 23.9 percent for his career. How about just top-12 type numbers? Prescott 47.9 percent, Brees at 48.9 percent. Don't devalue Prescott in fantasy, as he's a perfectly fine starter in 12-team leagues, particularly if you're stacked everywhere else"
3 weeks ago
109. DeSean Jackson WR - PHI (at NYG)
"Jackson returns to Philadelphia, though this time he's got a much better supporting cast. Between Alshon Jeffery and Zach Ertz, he won't be asked to be the focal point of the offense, but rather a game-changer in how a defense has to approach them. He still has the speed to beat cornerbacks down the field, as evidenced by his 18.9 yards per catch in 2018. Just don't draft him and expect WR2 numbers or anything. He'll be a splash player in the Eagles offense"
3 weeks ago
110. Philip Rivers QB - LAC (at KC)
"Here's the example of a player who's top-five at his position in real-life, but not when it comes to fantasy. You've probably heard it a million times - Rivers has been a top-14 quarterback in 11-of-13 seasons, so you're drafting him at his floor if he's being taken as the QB14. Well, no. Rivers is a very consistent quarterback, but he's not going to help lead your team to a championship. There was just one game in 2018 where he totaled more than 24 fantasy points, and it's because his defense has continually gotten better. He also doesn't offer anything rushing, so unless his defense takes a step back in 2019, he's not going to have much of a chance to deliver much better numbers in 2019"
3 weeks ago
111. Keke Coutee WR - HOU (vs . TEN)
"Coutee is a little banged up but shouldn't miss much time at all. The general public seems to be viewing Coutee as the distant number three weapon in this Texans' receiving corps, but with Will Fuller just 9 months removed from a torn ACL and DeAndre Hopkins on the PUP, Coutee may be in for a much larger target share than everyone realizes. Plus, Coutee actually had more targets than even Hopkins when the two shared the field together."
2 days ago
112. Marquez Valdes-Scantling WR - GB (at DET)
"Despite seeing just five targets in the first four games of the season, Valdes-Scantling finished his rookie season with a solid 581 yards and two touchdowns. He moved into the slot role when Randall Cobb was out of the lineup, which gives him a leg-up on the competition, as Geronimo Allison is likely starting on the perimeter, which means Equanimeous St. Brown would be the odd man out from last year. If Valdes-Scantling can earn more of Aaron Rodgers' trust, he could vault up into the WR3/4 conversation"

113. Matt Breida RB - SF (at SEA)
"Some are excited about Breida and how cheap he's coming in drafts, but you shouldn't be one of them. Think about it... Despite Jerick McKinnon being out for the year, Breida was forced to compete with Alfred Morris and Raheem Mostert for touches. Not only did they get the high-priced McKinnon back, but they signed Tevin Coleman. None of this looks good for Breida, who's been under Kyle Shanahan the last two years, but has been given no vote of confidence. He's just a handcuff to Coleman/McKinnon at this point"

114. Emmanuel Sanders WR - DEN (vs . OAK)
"It is extremely difficult, if not impossible to return to form following an achillies injury. Sanders has tons of upside if he can break the trend, however, as he was a top 10 wide receiver deep into last season and now has what may be an upgrade at the quarterback position."
6 days ago
115. LeSean McCoy RB - BUF (vs . NYJ)
"McCoy is not all that far removed from being productive, and while the upside is clearly limited in a Josh Allen offense, there is no substitute for touches and at this point, McCoy is the favorite to lead this crowded backfield. Don't think of him as much more than an RB3 if he does start, however."

116. Trey Burton TE - CHI (at MIN)
"It was supposed to be a breakout season for Burton in 2018 under Matt Nagy, but instead, it was a mediocre season. While he did finish as the No. 7 tight end, anyone who owned him can tell you it was frustrating. He played all 16 games, but he was hampered by some injuries at the end of the year. While year two could bring more consistency, we should have both Anthony Miller and Allen Robinson nearing full health, as they dealt with injuries as well in 2018. Burton isn't going to turn into Travis Kelce despite playing in the same offense, but he's still likely going to finish as a top-10 tight end at year's end"
3 weeks ago
117. Delanie Walker TE - TEN (at HOU)
"After missing all of the 2018 season, Walker returns to what looks like a full house of pass-catchers. He'll now compete with Corey Davis, A.J. Brown, and Adam Humphries for targets from Marcus Mariota, who really struggled in Walker's absence. While we look for reasons to fade Walker, he just might be the one Mariota looks back to in order to regain some confidence. He's not going to finish as a top-five tight end anymore, but top-12 is well within reach"
3 weeks ago
118. Golden Tate WR - NYG (vs . PHI)
"Going into last year, Tate had 90+ receptions in four straight seasons. He was actually on track to do it again to go with 1,200+ yards up until the trade, at which point he became an afterthought in an offense where he wasn't familiar with the playbook Don't be surprised when he returns to the norm from the moment he returns from his suspension since Beckham vacated so many targets."
2 weeks ago
119. Ronald Jones II RB - TB (vs . ATL)
"The Bucs told us all we needed to know in the draft and free agency - they don't feel like they need to add another running back. No one is suggesting they're confident Jones will tear the league up, but you should be confident that he's the starter in Bruce Arians' offense, which has historically netted great results. Peyton Barber isn't the long-term answer, so look for them to find out if Jones is, which requires more than the 30 touches he got as a rookie"
3 weeks ago
120. Duke Johnson RB - HOU (vs . TEN)
"Now that Duke is free in Houston, he should see a much larger role. Houston hasn't passed to running backs in the future, but they've also never had anyone like Duke before. Don't sleep on the idea that he could be a three-down back too if anything were to happen to Lamar Miller."
6 days ago
121. Dion Lewis RB - TEN (at HOU)
"With the display Derrick Henry put on at the end of the season, there is no chance Lewis leads the Titans' backfield this year unless Henry's injury is a bigger deal that it currently appears. That isn't to say Lewis won't have games where he splashes but predicting which week it will be is a difficult task so he should merely be thought of as a handcuff."
2 weeks ago
122. Donte Moncrief WR - PIT (at BAL)
"He's become somewhat of a journeyman at this point, looking for a home. Those type of receivers don't have 'breakout' years in year-six of their career. He'll battle with James Washington and rookie Diontae Johnson for snaps, though it should be expected that Moncrief will be on the field for three-wide sets with Washington and JuJu Smith-Schuster. Did you know Moncrief has just one 100-yard game over his last three seasons? He may catch touchdowns from time-to-time, but chemistry with a new quarterback isn't built overnight"
3 weeks ago
123. Michael Gallup WR - DAL (vs . WAS)
"Does everyone realize Gallup actually saw a lot more targets with Amari Cooper in the lineup? He went from 22 targets in the first seven games (3.1 per game) without Cooper, to 46 targets in the final nine games (5.1 per game) with Cooper, and that includes a zero-target game. He was a rookie last year, so it was only natural for his role to grow, and he did that despite Cooper coming there. He's probably going to be on a lot of sleeper lists come August"
3 weeks ago
124. Jordan Reed TE - WAS (at DAL)
"Did you know that when on the field, Reed has posted top 12 tight end numbers in 49.2 percent of his games? That's ahead of guys like Zach Ertz, Greg Olsen, and Hunter Henry. The issue has been staying on the field, as he's missed 31 games in his six years in the league. That's the only reason he's falling as far as he is in drafts. But once you get outside the top-seven or eight tight ends, you're likely going to wind-up streaming, so why not take a flier on a guy who presents top-five upside when healthy?"
3 weeks ago
125. Josh Allen QB - BUF (vs . NYJ)
"You know those analysts out there who have Allen ranked as a top-10 quarterback in 2019? Yeah, it's not because you'll be able to start him every week. No, it's because when he has big weeks, they're really big. He posted top-18-type numbers in just 50 percent of his games last year. Andy Dalton, Joe Flacco, and Nick Foles were better. However, Allen posted 26 or more points (boom) in 33.3 percent of his games, which ranked as the fourth-best number in football. Draft him in best-ball but stay away in redraft"
3 weeks ago
126. Kalen Ballage RB - MIA (at NE)
"Ballage is currently running with the first team in Miami's offense under the new Head Coach. He may end up like Chris Carson and flat out win the starting job, but it still seems more than likely that Drake will end up with the lion's share of the running back touches."
2 weeks ago
127. Kirk Cousins QB - MIN (vs . CHI)
"Despite him finishing as the No. 12 quarterback last year in what was a disastrous offensive season, it shows the floor Cousins should provide in fantasy. While the Vikings have said they'd like to run the ball more often, their offensive line isn't built to run the ball 30 times per game. Cousins has Stefon Diggs and Adam Thielen at his disposal with a year of chemistry between them. He's not someone you want to start every week, but he offers streaming potential when in games against high-scoring opponents"
3 weeks ago
128. Mitch Trubisky QB - CHI (at MIN)
"He missed two full games last year, had an entirely new offense to learn, and had all new pass-catchers. Seriously, not one was the same. Despite that, he finished as the QB15 on the season (No. 11 in points per game). It'll be his second year in Matt Nagy's offense and he didn't lose anyone. If you don't realize he has upside similar to Cam Newton, you're missing something. He rushed for at least 43 yards on five separate occasions. Most don't realize that despite playing in the same number of games and throwing 52 fewer passes, Trubisky outscored Baker Mayfield by 23.0 fantasy points in 2018."
1 week ago
129. Nyheim Hines RB - IND (at JAC)
"We already saw the role Hines will have on the Colts, as he's not the lead back but rather the passing-down back. He tallied 85 carries and 81 targets last year, which is more than enough volume in that high-scoring offense to be fantasy relevant. The Colts have said they want Marlon Mack to carry most of the workload, but think of Hines like the Duke Johnson of their offense. He should offer RB4 numbers regularly in PPR formats, though he doesn't offer much upside, even if Mack were to miss time, as they'd share the workload between him, Spencer Ware, and Jordan Wilkins"
3 weeks ago
130. Devin Funchess WR - IND (at JAC)
"Going from Cam Newton to Andrew Luck is going to feel really good for Funchess, as Newton isn't what you'd describe as an accurate passer, completing more than 61.7 percent of passes once in his career. Meanwhile, Luck completed 67.3 percent of his passes in 2018 in his first season under Frank Reich. It's going to be hard for him to find the targets he did in Carolina with so many mouths to feed, but he'll be a factor in the red zone opposite T.Y. Hilton, who hasn't been a big red zone presence during his career"
3 weeks ago
131. Adrian Peterson RB - WAS (at DAL)
"Peterson said he wants to rush for another 1,000 yards this season. Well, yeah, but how does he do that with a healthy Derrius Guice, Chris Thompson, and Bryce Love? It's either Guice isn't going to be ready to start the season, or Peterson is dreaming. If Guice isn't ready to start the year, Peterson should offer low-end RB2 value, but from everything that's been said, they're expecting Guice to be ready. Peterson is likely nothing more than a handcuff to Guice"
3 weeks ago
132. DaeSean Hamilton WR - DEN (vs . OAK)
"There are some expecting a breakout season from Hamilton after he posted four straight 40-plus yard games with two touchdowns in the final month of the season, but you should have some doubts. Not only is Courtland Sutton the No. 1 option on the team, but they also brought in Noah Fant, a possession-style tight end, in the first-round of the draft. On top of that, Joe Flacco has never really supported a consistent wide receiver in fantasy for more than spurts. Hamilton is talented, but it's likely the wrong situation to expect a breakout"
3 weeks ago
133. John Brown WR - BUF (vs . NYJ)
"Prior to Lamar Jackson taking over and throwing far less, Brown was once again a dynamic fantasy receiver. His only issue has been staying on the field. This isn't a strong passing game by any means, but he should be the #1 once again."
6 days ago
134. James Washington WR - PIT (at BAL)
"His rookie season didn't produce big stats for Washington despite him starting for a portion of the season, but that hasn't stopped his quarterback and head coach from talking him up. The way Ben Roethlisberger talks about Washington is the same way Aaron Rodgers talked about Davante Adams after a bad rookie campaign, saying he sees the player in practice, but they just need to translate it to the game. With Antonio Brown gone, you're going to see Washington get his shot in 2019"
3 weeks ago
135. Jack Doyle TE - IND (at JAC)
"Is it possible that we're all overrating Eric Ebron and underrating Doyle? When both were on the field last year, Doyle led the two of them in both snaps and targets"
3 weeks ago
136. Jamison Crowder WR - NYJ (at BUF)
"When Crowder signed with the Jets early in free agency, we're not sure why more people didn't like it. Remember when Quincy Enunwa played in the slot prior to Jermaine Kearse returning to the lineup? Enunwa totaled 37 targets over the first four weeks. Then Kearse took over and proceeded to get 48 targets over the next six weeks. The point is that Sam Darnold does like his slot receiver and the Jets signed Crowder very early in free agency, highlighting the need. He's just not a sexy pick, which is why the consensus is lower on him"
3 weeks ago
137. N'Keal Harry WR - NE (vs . MIA)
"We're always left looking for the next big thing in the Patriots offense, only most of those hyped players never pan out. The Patriots spent a first-round pick on Harry to walk in and start right away, but how will he fare as a rookie receiver who will get minimal time with Tom Brady. Remember, Brady doesn't show up early in training camp like some younger quarterbacks, so it's going to be difficult for those two to develop instant chemistry on the field. There's likely going to be some highs his rookie season, but there's also going to be some downs"
3 weeks ago
138. Tyrell Williams WR - OAK (at DEN)
"The season in which Williams broke out was when Keenan Allen got injured, while playing with Philip Rivers. Now he'll go to play behind Antonio Brown with Derek Carr at quarterback. Tying yourself to the No. 2 option under Derek Carr doesn't seem smart when he hasn't supported a consistent No. 1 option to this point in his career"
3 weeks ago
139. Jimmy Garoppolo QB - SF (at SEA)
"Did you guys watch Nick Mullens and C.J. Beathard produce half-decent fantasy numbers last year? Between them two, they posted 198.5 fantasy points over the 13 games that Garoppolo didn't play. Over the course of a full season, that would have amounted to the No. 16 quarterback. That was with Marquise Goodwin missing in action much of the time, with Pierre Garcon out for the year, and with Dante Pettis not getting on the field in a full-time role until the end of the season. Not only will Pettis be a full-time receiver, but the 49ers also drafted Deebo Samuel and Jalen Hurd inside the top three rounds. The running backs on the roster are all better pass-catchers than they are ball-carriers, which again favors Garoppolo"
3 weeks ago
140. Tom Brady QB - NE (vs . MIA)
"What happens to the No. 17 fantasy quarterback when you take away the best tight end of all-time? It's not likely to make him any better. The Patriots have added another running back to the stable, which hints that they'll try to pound the ball a bit more. Yes, they added N'Keal Harry in the first-round, but rookie receivers tend to take time to develop. Brady is one of the greatest of all-time, but he shouldn't be someone you're drafting to your fantasy team"
3 weeks ago
141. Jimmy Graham TE - GB (at DET)
"Most don't realize Graham finished with just two touchdowns last year, something we should never expect to happen again. Why? Throughout his nine-year career, he's caught a touchdown an average of every 13.4 targets. There's been just two occasions where he's averaged more than 15.8 targets. It was likely due to the fact that Aaron Rodgers had just 25 passing scores and finished with a career-low touchdown percentage. Year two should lead to more chemistry, and you should bet on Rodgers bouncing back"
3 weeks ago
142. Mark Andrews TE - BAL (vs . PIT)
"The Ravens have what seems like 100 tight ends but among them, Andrews is the best bet to produce. He has a chance to be the breakout player of the year at the position if Lamar Jackson is trusted to pass more, but that ceiling only makes him waiver wire speed dial worthy instead of draftable."
1 week ago
143. Peyton Barber RB - TB (vs . ATL)
"Some believe Barber still has the inside-track on the starting job, though if you've read the tea leaves this offseason, everything is hinting towards Ronald Jones as the starter. While it's possible Barber is nothing more than a backup, it's also possible that Jones is just not very good, making him slightly more valuable than just a handcuff, though that's likely what he'll be"
3 weeks ago
144. Carlos Hyde RB - KC (vs . LAC)
"Damien Williams is expected to open the season and Kansas City's starting running back, but he has never handled a large workload even in college so it is possible that the Chiefs acquired Hyde to handle a chunk of those touches. Andy Reid has also been claiming this will be a split backfield with Williams and Hyde making a running back committee."
6 days ago
145. Kyle Rudolph TE - MIN (vs . CHI)
"After getting his contract extension to stay with the Vikings, it should be expected for him to remain the starter while they bring rookie Irv Smith Jr. along slowly. Rudolph may have shown up as the No. 8 fantasy tight end at year's end, but he produced top-12 type numbers in just 31.3 percent of his games, while scoring less than 7.0 PPR points in 43.8 percent of his games. With the Vikings talking about a more run-heavy approach in 2019, Rudolph's numbers will suffer even more"
3 weeks ago
146. Jaylen Samuels RB - PIT (at BAL)
"The Steelers have talked about sharing the workload in the backfield, and they reinforced that when they drafted Benny Snell in the fourth-round of the NFL Draft. Samuels was never meant to be a 20-plus touch back, but he's likely going to be involved much more, even when James Conner is healthy. The issue is that Snell is a threat to his upside and would likely be the primary back if Conner were to go down with an injury. Because of that, Samuels may be locked into a Chris Thompson/Giovani Bernard type role, which doesn't do much for your fantasy team. Unless we hear he's the primary backup, he's not someone you should roster"
3 weeks ago
147. Kenny Stills WR - MIA (at NE)
"If you're looking for a receiver to finish much higher than his draft position, Stills practically always does this. Did you know he was a top-30 wide receiver in both 2016 and 2017, then the No. 52 receiver in 2018? It's a new coaching staff and that'll shake things up, but the upgrade at quarterback is appealing. He may not be a sexy pick, but he's continually undervalued"
3 weeks ago
148. Greg Olsen TE - CAR (vs . NO)
"We've made it through another offseason and Olsen is still playing football. He's considered retirement multiple times, but maybe he's returning because his life is probably easier with D.J. Moore and Curtis Samuel on the field? The bad news is that he's no longer the No. 1 target in the offense and he's continually losing targets to Christian McCaffrey, who set the record for receptions by a running back in 2018. Through 16 games the last two seasons, Olsen has seen a combined 76 targets, totaling 482 yards and five touchdowns. He has played through some injuries, so that's not exactly precise, but it's not far off from what you'll get out of him moving forward"
3 weeks ago
149. D.K. Metcalf WR - SEA (vs . SF)
"You've likely heard of the big 6-foot-3, 227-pound wide receiver who ran a 4.3-second 40-yard dash by now. He comes into the NFL a bit raw in his route tree and will take some time to develop, but one thing we know about him is that he can beat anyone deep in one-on-one coverage. Russell Wilson can chuck the ball downfield with precision, too. It's not to say Metcalf will be consistent in his rookie year, but there's going to be some games you wish he was in your starting lineup"
3 weeks ago
150. Devin Singletary RB - BUF (vs . NYJ)
"He was touted as one of the most elusive running backs in the class until he had a horrid Combine performance. Still, the Bills invested a third-round pick in him, so they were clearly still high on him. The issue is that he's got three veterans to battle on the depth chart, which means he's not likely to play a role, especially early in the season"
3 weeks ago
151. Damien Harris RB - NE (vs . MIA)
"We're not advocating Harris as a starting running back in the Patriots offense, but rather saying that, at the very least, he's one of the best handcuffs in all of football. His price doesn't reflect that. In fact, the Patriots taking him in the third-round when they're clearly in win-now mode says a lot, so don't be surprised if he has a role even if Sony Michel is ahead of him on the depth chart"
3 weeks ago
152. Sam Darnold QB - NYJ (at BUF)
"If there's one thing Darnold has going for him in 2019, it's that he's not going to be benched. Duh, right? Well, that's important for those playing in 2QB leagues, as there are other quarterbacks in his territory who have a chance of getting benched. He was hot and cold throughout his rookie season, though it helps they brought in Le'Veon Bell and Jamison Crowder as pass-catching options. The downside, however, is that Adam Gase is his head coach, who traditionally runs minimal plays for his offense"
3 weeks ago
153. Adam Humphries WR - TEN (at HOU)
"Humphries was tremendous at the close of the season for Tampa, and while New England may have been a better landing spot, he falls into a nice spot in Tennessee too where there is limited competition for targets. He makes for a solid WR5 with bye week appeal."
6 days ago
154. Marquise Goodwin WR - SF (at SEA)
"There have been games with Goodwin that make everyone want to believe he's more than just a role player. It's why he was being drafted as a top-36 wide receiver last year. A year later, everyone has forgotten about him. The 49ers have drafted three wide receivers inside the top three rounds over the last two years, but as we saw with Dante Pettis last year, it doesn't mean they'll get on the field right away. Goodwin still possesses game-changing speed down the field, but is likely going to lose snaps as the year goes on"
3 weeks ago
155. Dallas Goedert TE - PHI (at NYG)
"If there were ever such a thing as a tight end handcuff, Goedert would be it. Should something happen to Zach Ertz that would force him to miss time, Goedert would be a plug-and-play top-five option every week. Unfortunately, he doesn't have much value outside of that, as there simply aren't enough targets to go around. That was clear last year when he saw more than five targets just once all season"
3 weeks ago
156. Tre'Quan Smith WR - NO (at CAR)
"It's year two for Smith, who had a chance to work his way into the starting lineup with Ted Ginn missing most of 2018, but Ginn is back for 2019. It's tough to find the targets for Smith, as the Saints now have Michael Thomas, Ginn, Alvin Kamara, and newly-acquired Jared Cook taking much of the target share. It's possible Ginn fades away and Smith assumes the No. 2 receiver role, but it's not likely to start that way. He's a better best-ball target than he is in redraft"
3 weeks ago
157. Chris Herndon IV TE - NYJ (at BUF)
"Did Herndon make a splash during his rookie season? Yes, he did. Does that mean it'll continue in year two? No. The offense has been completely overhauled, starting up top with the head coach Adam Gase, who turned Mike Gesicki into an afterthought in fantasy, though many experts had him as the top tight end in last year's class. The Jets also added Jamison Crowder and Le'Veon Bell, two players who'll take targets away from Herndon over the middle of the field. Gase's offense has produced less than 58 plays in two of his last three seasons and the Jets are likely to play solid defense with a ball-control style offense. That doesn't add up to much for last year's promising rookie"
3 weeks ago
158. Matthew Stafford QB - DET (vs . GB)
"2018 was a year to forget for Stafford, as he posted the worst numbers since his rookie season. He'd been about as predictable as they come for eight years, posting QB1 numbers at least 37.5 percent of the time in every season (while hitting 50-plus percent twice), but hit just 12.5 percent of the time in 2018. Did the new coaching staff hurt him that much? He's been a better fantasy quarterback throughout his career than Ben Roethlisberger has been, though you wouldn't know it by their draft positions"
3 weeks ago
159. Ito Smith RB - ATL (at TB)
"After an impressive rookie campaign where he played more than expected, Smith will look to build on his 117-touch, 467-yard rookie season. He'll play alongside Devonta Freeman who's dealt with some injuries as of late and is now 27 years old. The Falcons may choose to employ a timeshare, but it's likely it's a 70/30 split between the two. Smith would offer weekly RB2 potential if Freeman were to miss any time, making him a valuable handcuff who has some standalone value even without injury"
3 weeks ago
160. Devante Parker WR - MIA (at NE)
"It might pain your ears to hear it, but when Parker is on the field, he hasn't been terrible. In fact, he's turned in WR3 or better performances in 44.7 percent of his games, which is better than the career rates of Emmanuel Sanders, Robert Woods, and Kenny Golladay. A new coaching staff will likely do him some good as it appeared he and Adam Gase never truly saw eye-to-eye. The quarterback position has improved, and from the reports of local beat reporters, Parker has dominated mini-camp. Could this be the year he finally breaks out?"
3 weeks ago
161. T.J. Hockenson TE - DET (vs . GB)
"A rookie tight end in fantasy football? That usually amounts to fantasy owners being let down. There have been 70 tight ends who've been drafted inside the top six rounds of the NFL Draft since 2013. Just one of them went on to finish as a top-12 fantasy tight end. That was Evan Engram who needed injuries to Odell Beckham, Brandon Marshall, and Sterling Shepard to get there. If Marvin Jones and Kenny Golladay were to go down with injuries, then it's okay to rely on the rookie Hockenson"
3 weeks ago
162. Derek Carr QB - OAK (at DEN)
"It's definitely not going to hurt Carr's chances by adding Antonio Brown to his stable of wide receivers, but we mustn't forget he had Amari Cooper for the first few years of his career. This isn't to say Cooper is on Brown's level, but more to do with Carr's inability to be consistent. He's performed at a top-12 level in just 29.5 percent of his 78 career games, which is worse than the career of DeShone Kizer and Blake Bortles. Even if he steps up his passing, his lack of rushing totals severely caps his upside. He's not a bad option in 2QB leagues for those who wait, as he has no chance of being benched, but stay away in standard leagues"
3 weeks ago
163. Mohamed Sanu WR - ATL (at TB)
"When looking for a spot-starter who you know will give you a solid floor, look no further than the underrated Sanu. Since joining the Falcons, he's delivered WR3 or better numbers in 50 percent of his games. That's over three years. Do you know how many receivers were able to do that in 2018 alone? Just 32 of them. He's not going to finish as a top-20 wide receiver or anything, but he's a stable producer who is essentially free"
3 weeks ago
164. Albert Wilson WR - MIA (at NE)
"He only played seven games last year, but his 16-game pace in them was 894 yards and 9 touchdowns. Maybe he was being underutilized in Kansas City? The issue with relying on that production in 2019 is due to the new coaching staff, as they'll install a new offense, which will put him in a new role. It's hard to figure out exactly what the roles of the wide receivers are in that offense, but Wilson showed the team what he's capable of in 2018"
3 weeks ago
165. Robert Foster WR - BUF (vs . NYJ)
"There are many taking solace in the fact that Foster finished with three 100-yard games over the final seven weeks, and while it was impressive, it's not repeatable. He saw more than five targets in just two games, not nearly enough to have consistent production. On top of that, the Bills went out and snagged both John Brown and Cole Beasley in free agency. Unless they bench their leading receiver last year (Zay Jones), Foster won't be on the field very much. It's possible he overtakes Jones, but do you really want the third option on a run-first team. Pass on Foster and let someone else cut him after the first few weeks"

166. Chicago Bears DST - CHI (at MIN)
The Bears were so far and away the number one defense in 2018 that you can make a case for taking them a round or two before every other defense begins to go. They return most of their talent and should be a safe play most weeks.
9 weeks ago
167. Kareem Hunt RB - CLE (at CIN)
"There's no easy way to put this, but DO NOT DRAFT Hunt in your redraft league this year. It doesn't matter if he's there in the 13th round, let someone else take on that burden. Not only is he suspended for the first eight games of the season, but he's behind a guy who rushed for nearly 1,000 yards despite not starting until Week 7. Did I mention that running back was also drafted by the Browns at the start of the second-round in 2018? The first four weeks of the season are the most important weeks of the season for the waiver wire, so why hold yourself hostage with a guy who's not even a lock to play once his suspension is over? Not to mention bye week issues you'll have. On top of that, you've never seen him outside a Chiefs offense, where every running back put in the lineup succeeds. I'm not saying he's not a good player, but Chubb is better"

168. Justin Jackson RB - LAC (at KC)
"If Melvin Gordon is on the field, Jackson will have zero value outside of a darkhorse handcuff. He can be quickly released if that scenario plays out. With that said, the Gordon holdout threat is legitimate and if it happens, Jackson may overtake Ekeler as the primary back and could be a superstar in this offense if given the opportunity."
1 week ago
169. Quincy Enunwa WR - NYJ (at BUF)
170. Noah Fant TE - DEN (vs . OAK)
"It can be argued that Fant has the better opportunity than T.J. Hockenson this year, as the Broncos receiving corps is likely to be without Emmanuel Sanders to start the year, and they have Joe Flacco at the helm, who's always gravitated towards his tight ends. Fant has a ways to go in his blocking, but as a receiver, he should be able to contribute right away. However, knowing what we do about rookie tight ends, it's best to just stream Fant when he has a good matchup rather than draft him"
3 weeks ago
171. Chris Thompson RB - WAS (at DAL)
Thompson doesn't come with much upside since he will never be anything more than a third-down back and because Washington's offense is dreadful but he is among the best pass-catching backs you'll find and he still has big-play ability.
6 days ago
172. Parris Campbell WR - IND (at JAC)
"There are many who are expecting Campbell to walk into the Colts offense and make an immediate impact, but that may be tough considering he might be the fifth target in the offense behind T.Y. Hilton, Eric Ebron, Jack Doyle, Nyheim Hines, and maybe even Devin Funchess. There's no doubt that Campbell is explosive with the ball in his hands, but the targets might be sporadic in year one"
3 weeks ago
173. Deebo Samuel WR - SF (at SEA)
"After drafting Samuel in the second-round, you'd assume he'll be on the field Week 1 for a 49ers team that lacks much top-end talent at the wide receiver position, but that may not be the case"
3 weeks ago
174. C.J. Anderson RB - DET (vs . GB)
"After watching C.J. Anderson carry the Rams offense at the end of last season, he settled for a one-year deal with the Lions to play alongside the up-and-coming Kerryon Johnson. The Lions do want to use a timeshare, so it's likely Anderson inherits the LeGarrette Blount role in the offense, which netted 164 touches last year, though it helped that Johnson missed time at the end of the year. If you combined Blount and Zach Zenner's roles from last year, they netted 209 carries, 683 yards, and eight touchdowns on the ground. Anderson is going to clog upside on your bench as long as Johnson is in the lineup. If Johnson were to miss time, Anderson would likely be considered a low-end RB2"
3 weeks ago
175. Jacksonville Jaguars DST - JAC (vs . IND)
"Like last season, it may not quite work out how everyone was hoping but even then, the Jags weren't terrible on defense. That was their floor and we know the upside is the top unit in potentially a decade so don't hesitate to draft them but with a short leash if it doesn't work out again."
9 weeks ago
176. Justice Hill RB - BAL (vs . PIT)
"The Ravens clearly wanted to revamp their run-game this offseason, bringing in Mark Ingram in free agency, then drafting the versatile Hill. His game is comparable to Reggie Bush, which is great for the timeshare role he's slated for. Despite weighing in at just 200 pounds, Hill is able to handle a large workload, too, as he tallied 632 carries and 49 receptions in just three years at Oklahoma State. He'll likely start in the passing-down role and can earn more touches as the year goes on"
3 weeks ago
177. Jamaal Williams RB - GB (at DET)
"He's had his opportunity to shine in the starting role, but has clearly been surpassed by Aaron Jones as the superior running back at this point. Williams can handle a large workload if something were to happen to Jones, which gives him good handcuff value in the high-scoring Packers offense. There's been some whispers of a light timeshare, which may give you value without injury, but you shouldn't bank on it"
3 weeks ago
178. Andy Dalton QB - CIN (vs . CLE)
"Did you know that 2018 was the first year Dalton didn't finish as a top-18 fantasy quarterback? It's because he's been durable and has had little-to-no chance of being benched. The early reports out of camp say that Ryan Finley has looked pretty bad, meaning Dalton will once again be entrenched as the starter. If you're in a 2QB league, he'll suffice. If you're in a standard 1QB league, he's streaming material in good matchups"
3 weeks ago
179. Los Angeles Rams DST - LAR (vs . ARI)
"The Rams had a powerful offense but we all know they made the Super Bowl because of their defense. As a result of that strength, they finished #2 in fantasy points last season at the position, but with plenty of talent lost, they have dropped back a rung in the rankings."
9 weeks ago
180. Zay Jones WR - BUF (vs . NYJ)
181. Baltimore Ravens DST - BAL (vs . PIT)
"Baltimore finished 2nd among D/STs in fantasy points in 2017 and 5th in 2018 so you may consider them a lock to finish top 10 in 2019, but they lost more talent on that side of the ball than any team this off-season so they are merely a streamer for now."
9 weeks ago
182. Giovani Bernard RB - CIN (vs . CLE)
"He's on the final year of his deal with the Bengals, so it makes sense they'd draft a running back. But two of them? Trayveon Williams is likely his replacement next year, while Rodney Anderson presents workhorse ability when healthy. This is looking like an ugly mix behind Joe Mixon in 2019, meaning you should just let someone else take Bernard in your drafts"
3 weeks ago
183. Minnesota Vikings DST - MIN (vs . CHI)
"The Vikings have finished as a D/ST1 each of the past five seasons and are a good bet to do the same once again in 2019 since they return the vast majority of their talent. There are several unplayable games on their schedule, however, so make sure you have a plan for those if you draft them."
9 weeks ago
184. Los Angeles Chargers DST - LAC (at KC)
"The Chargers' D/ST disappointed in 2018, finishing tied for 14th, but they come into 2019 with a full bill of health and more talent than perhaps any other unit in the league so they should be one of, if not the top, D/ST drafted this year."
9 weeks ago
185. Greg Zuerlein K - LAR (vs . ARI)
Greg the Leg has plenty of potential thanks the Sean McVay and deep range. He missed some time last year but was the #1 fantasy kicker when healthy.
6 days ago
186. David Moore WR - SEA (vs . SF)
"It appears right now that Moore will be in the starting lineup alongside Tyler Lockett in two wide receiver sets, which provides a significant amount of value. He's tied to Russell Wilson, one of the most accurate and efficient quarterbacks in the league. No one would know that better than Moore, who turned 53 targets into 26 receptions, 445 yards, and five touchdowns. If he has a clear hold on the job, he should be moved into the WR4/5 conversation"
3 weeks ago
187. Mike Davis RB - CHI (at MIN)
"When the Bears signed Davis, it appeared he was taking over the Jordan Howard role in the offense. That was until they moved up in the third-round and drafted workhorse David Montgomery. The Bears were lacking depth behind Howard and Tarik Cohen last year, and although Davis is high-priced depth, it's hard to imagine him getting more than 5-8 touches per game with Montgomery and Cohen healthy. He is, however, one of the better handcuffs, as he's a capable three-down back who'd walk into RB2 production with an injury in front of him"
3 weeks ago
188. Nick Foles QB - JAC (vs . IND)
"If there's one thing Foles has going for him, it's that he won't get benched. After signing a four-year, $88 million contract, he's entrenched as the starter, which means something to those playing in 2QB formats. Outside of his bye week (and potential injury), Foles can be in your lineup. Understand that his upside is nearly non-existent without a true No. 1 receiver or tight end, and on a team who is going to be run-heavy. He'll likely finish as a top-24 quarterback due to his job security, but I wouldn't draft him as such"
3 weeks ago
189. Jerick McKinnon RB - SF (at SEA)
"Now that McKinnon is headed to the PUP with the knee issue flaring back up, there is no sense in drafting him. He may eventually prove to be a worthwhile mid-season waiver add, but even that seems optimistic at this point."
6 days ago
190. Marcus Mariota QB - TEN (at HOU)
"Even if you're in a 2QB format, it's tough to rely on Mariota, who is reportedly going to be forced to compete for the starting job heading into the 2019 season. They brought in Ryan Tannehill, who has extremely similar numbers throughout his career to Mariota despite playing with lesser talent. The worst part about Mariota is that he's declined in each of the last two seasons, as this is the time in his career where he's supposed to be coming into his own. He's nothing more than a QB3 hopeful despite all the talent around him"
3 weeks ago
191. Taylor Gabriel WR - CHI (at MIN)
"Did you realize Gabriel saw 93 targets in 2018? That ranked 36th among wide receivers, so he's clearly a big part of Matt Nagy's offense. That's unlikely to happen again considering Allen Robinson and Anthony Miller are healthy, but he's still going to play a role. If you're looking for a high-ceiling player to help fill some bye weeks, he could be that guy"
3 weeks ago
192. Houston Texans DST - HOU (vs . TEN)
"Hoston's fate rests in the health of J.J. Watt. If he gets injured, feel free to stream like everyone else, but so long as he stays healthy, you've got a top five D/ST on your roster that you can use most weeks."
9 weeks ago
193. Cleveland Browns DST - CLE (at CIN)
"If you are planning on streaming D/STs this season, the Browns should be your target, as they draw the Titans in Week 1 followed by the Jets in Week 2. Not only that, but they also have one of the most talented and complete depth charts in the NFL."
9 weeks ago
194. Mike Gesicki TE - MIA (at NE)
"It was a disastrous rookie season for Gesicki. Despite seeing just 11 targets, Raiders backup tight end Lee Smith outscored Gesicki in fantasy football. You can blame Adam Gase. You can blame Ryan Tannehill. You can blame the fact that he was a rookie. The issue is that he didn't flash even when targeted and will now play for a defensive-minded head coach. We know he's a phenomenal athlete, but there was nothing he did in 2018 that suggests breakout in 2019"
3 weeks ago
195. Justin Tucker K - BAL (vs . PIT)
Tucker has now been a top five fantasy kicker each of the last four years. That type of consistency out of the position is virtually unheard of.
9 weeks ago
196. Marquise Brown WR - BAL (vs . PIT)
"Brown may very well be a second version of DeSean Jackson, but fantasy owners certainly can't expect that right away as he might not have full agility back until October. With that said, if your league has enough bench spots, Brown may be worth waiting for."
1 week ago
197. Harrison Butker K - KC (vs . LAC)
"When drafting a kicker, look to find someone in a good offense. It doesn't get much better than what Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid have going on in Kansas City."
9 weeks ago
198. Jalen Richard RB - OAK (at DEN)
199. Randall Cobb WR - DAL (vs . WAS)
200. Mecole Hardman WR - KC (vs . LAC)
"There are a lot of expectations being placed on Hardman, though it'd likely be wise to be cautious with a player who caught just 60 balls in three years at Georgia. The Chiefs did show confidence when reaching for him in the second-round when most had him pegged for Day 3 prospect. Even if Tyreek Hill is suspended, Hardman is behind both Sammy Watkins and Demarcus Robinson on the wide receiver depth chart, so temper expectations unless we hear he'll play over Robinson"
3 weeks ago
201. Stephen Gostkowski K - NE (vs . MIA)
"The Patriots offense is clearly slowing down as Tom Brady ages, but Gostkowski has been a top 2 fantasy kicker more often than he hasn't over the last decade."
9 weeks ago
202. Tyler Eifert TE - CIN (vs . CLE)
"His breakout season in 2015 seems so far away at this point, it's hard to rely on the tight end who's played just 14 games over the last three years. When on the field, Eifert has been extremely solid, but there's been a new offense installed in Cincinnati. Now dealing with competition between A.J. Green, Tyler Boyd, Joe Mixon, and John Ross, it's unlikely Eifert will ever get the targets needed to become a consistent fantasy option"
3 weeks ago
203. A.J. Brown WR - TEN (at HOU)
"The Titans don't have a load of talent in the receiving corps but they sure to have a lot of mediocre mouths to feed. It is possible that Brown plays his way into a starting job from the get-go, but rather, this already poor passing offense will be a frustrating one from a fantasy standpoint because of the unpredictability of targets from week to week."
2 days ago
204. Wil Lutz K - NO (at CAR)
Lutz is not only tied to a great and consistent offense but he spends more than half his games kicking in a dome so he is a top-tier fantasy kicker.
9 weeks ago
205. Chase Edmonds RB - ARI (at LAR)
"The former fourth-rounder from last year is slated to be the backup for David Johnson in an offense that's expected to run close to 70 plays per game. If that's the case, Johnson will need breathers from time-to-time, which means Edmonds might be more than just a backup. It's possible he'll get 5-10 touches per game, which could offer flex potential during bye weeks, though he comes with RB2 upside should Johnson miss any time"
3 weeks ago
206. New Orleans Saints DST - NO (at CAR)
"We have grown accustomed to thinking shootouts when we see the Saints on the schedule, but the fact of the matter is that their defense has actually been quite good over their last 25 games. You can draft them as a Week 1 streamer versus the Texans' horrid offensive line, and perhaps you'll end up with much more than a streamer."
9 weeks ago
207. Ted Ginn WR - NO (at CAR)
208. Gerald Everett TE - LAR (vs . ARI)
"Last year may not have produced phenomenal results, but Everett did see a 31 percent increase in targets. Part of that likely comes from the fact that Cooper Kupp was out of the lineup for much of the season, freeing up some targets. Sean McVay's offense doesn't seem to allot many targets to the tight end position, so it's tough to see a breakout happening with Everett"
3 weeks ago
209. Marqise Lee WR - JAC (vs . IND)
"Most don't realize just how good Lee has been when on the field, with Blake Bortles nonetheless. In the 29 games he played in 2016 and 2017, he finished as a WR3 or better in 17 of them (59 percent). Throughout the 2018 season, there were just 25 wide receivers who hit that mark. One of those seasons was while playing alongside Allen Robinson. He may not be the same player and it's a different situation, but he's shown that he can be a contributor in fantasy"
3 weeks ago
210. Rex Burkhead RB - NE (vs . MIA)
"Burkhead has been unable to stay on the field the last two seasons for New England but while he is healthy, he has produced as a strong RB3 thanks to his receiving and goal-line production. That shouldn't change this year with the receiver corps being virtually non-existent."
2 days ago
211. Denver Broncos DST - DEN (vs . OAK)
"The Broncos are nowhere near the same shutdown defense that carried an old Peyton Manning to the Super Bowl, but they still have enough left in the tank that you can draft them as your D/ST, especially to play in Week 1 as a streamer versus the Raiders."
9 weeks ago
212. Alexander Mattison RB - MIN (vs . CHI)
"Dalvin Cook hasn't been what you'd describe as the healthiest running back in his NFL career, which is why you watched the Vikings reach for Mattison in the third-round. He's going to fill the Latavius Murray role in the offense while Cook is healthy, which won't exactly lead to startable numbers in fantasy, but you'd be grabbing him at the chance Cook misses time. There were nine different games in 2018 where Murray totaled 11 or more touches"
3 weeks ago
213. New England Patriots DST - NE (vs . MIA)
The Patriots managed to finish fourth among all D/STs last year thanks to an extremely low 325 points allowed. Their game scripts often lead to extra sacks and interceptions as well so they make for an excellent streamer in certain weeks and you could make a case for them as your starting D/ST to open the season.
9 weeks ago
214. Gus Edwards RB - BAL (vs . PIT)
"Edwards did absolutely nothing in the Ravens passing game last year, but piled up the rushing yards and if anything were to happen to Mark Ingram, he would be expected to do it again in Baltimore with Lamar Jackson under center."
3 weeks ago
215. John Ross WR - CIN (vs . CLE)
"You know it happens every preseason. A speedy receiver will get free and go for a long touchdown. That's going to be Ross this year and while some will dismiss it, you shouldn't. It's a new offense, one that's designed after the Rams, which has been a very WR-friendly system. Don't be so quick to judge a wide receiver who was playing in a bad offense. Remember Robert Woods before he went to the Rams? Ross will rise up draft boards come late August"
3 weeks ago
216. Buffalo Bills DST - BUF (vs . NYJ)
"The Bills didn't do much in fantasy terms last year, but they still have plenty of talent, draw the Dolphins and Jets twice each, and play a slow pace on offense so they are once again a fringe top-12 unit."
9 weeks ago
217. Joe Flacco QB - DEN (vs . OAK)
"Although the Broncos drafted Drew Lock, it wasn't until the second round so it is by no means certain that he will ever overtake Flacco for the starting job. With that said, Flacco's job isn't safe if he performs poorly again, and the receiver corps certainly won't help so think of him as a QB3 in SuperFlex leagues."
2 days ago
218. Trey Quinn WR - WAS (at DAL)
"Someone has to lead this Washington roster in targets and Quinn appears to have as good of a chance as anyone seeing that he is a strong route runner. Even so, his upside is limited to a WR4 flex type, and that's if everything goes right."
3 weeks ago
219. Nelson Agholor WR - PHI (at NYG)
"The addition of DeSean Jackson all but guarantees that Agholor has his slot gig in-between Jackson and Alshon Jeffery. Moving back to the slot is going to be huge for Agholor, as he's really struggled on the perimeter throughout his career. Of the 66 wide receivers who totaled at least 40 targets in each of the last two seasons, Agholor ranked as the No. 63 receiver in points per target on the perimeter, while he ranked No. 12 in points per target in the slot"
3 weeks ago
220. Andy Isabella WR - ARI (at LAR)
"Isabella was exceptional in college and is so fast that we may seem him break a few long plays for touchdowns this season. Assuming he can win that third receiver job, he may have flex appeal in your fantasy league before long."
6 days ago
221. Ka'imi Fairbairn K - HOU (vs . TEN)
"Fairbairn was the number one fantasy kicker last season and while that is tough to repeat, he is absolutely draft worthy."
9 weeks ago
222. Mason Crosby K - GB (at DET)
"Even with Aaron Rodgers playing injured, Crosby finished among the top five fantasy kickers last season so his upside is high if Rodgers can return to his usual production."
9 weeks ago
223. Dallas Cowboys DST - DAL (vs . WAS)
"If you aren't able to grab the Browns as your Week 1 streamer, you might want to turn your attention to Dallas, who not only draws the Giants in Week 1 and the Redskins in Week 2, but actually had an excellent defense by surprise last season."
9 weeks ago
224. Malcolm Brown RB - LAR (vs . ARI)
"Coach Sean McVay has made it clear that both Henderson and Brown will be plenty involved this season which makes sense considering they used a tender to ensure Brown remained on their roster. He may not quite be the second option, but absolutely has some upside in this high-powered offense."
2 weeks ago
225. Paul Richardson WR - WAS (at DAL)
"He was the clear-cut No. 1 receiver on the team before getting hurt last year, so it's odd to see him completely forgotten about, but not many are expecting big things from Case Keenum. Richardson had seen at least five targets in 6-of-7 games before going down for the season, and that was with Jamison Crowder on the roster. While the Redskins did draft a few receivers, they've talked about taking snaps away from Josh Doctson, so it would even out a bit. He could be someone you look to during problems with bye weeks"
3 weeks ago
226. Jake Elliott K - PHI (at NYG)
"Elliott was merely tied as the number 15 fantasy kicker last season but with Carson Wentz now fully recovered from injury, that could change in a heartbeat for 2019."
9 weeks ago
227. Philadelphia Eagles DST - PHI (at NYG)
228. Seattle Seahawks DST - SEA (vs . SF)
229. Danny Amendola WR - DET (vs . GB)
"Drafting Amendola isn't going to win you a fantasy championship, but he's probably not going to lose you one, either. Landing in Detroit was ideal, as Matthew Stafford has loved his slot option throughout his career, including last year when they brought in Bruce Ellington off the street to fill Golden Tate's shoes. He tallied 30 targets in four games with the team, catching 23 of them for 132 yards. While it wasn't massive production, volume is key with PPR receivers like Amendola. If you're looking for someone to help fill bye weeks, don't be shocked if Amendola is a popular waiver wire add at that time"
3 weeks ago
230. Brett Maher K - DAL (vs . WAS)
Maher may not be a top 12 fantasy kicker but whoever you are drafting will likely be cut after a week or two so don't hesitate to grab Maher in a delicious Week 1 matchup versus the Giants.
9 weeks ago
231. Antonio Callaway WR - CLE (at CIN)
232. Matt Prater K - DET (vs . GB)
"Prater finished in the top 10 among fantasy kickers once again last season and while Detroit's offense isn't among the best in the league, Prater's big leg makes him worthy of being drafted in fantasy leagues."
9 weeks ago
233. Josh Doctson WR - WAS (at DAL)
234. Robbie Gould K - SF (at SEA)
"With Jimmy G returning to run San Francisco's offense, you can expect them to spend plenty of time in the red zone and putting up points. Gould is a safe and consistent bet for fantasy points as a result."
9 weeks ago
235. D.J. Chark WR - JAC (vs . IND)
"The Jaguars clearly thought Chark would be a big part of their offense when they drafted him in the second-round of the 2018 draft, but his 32 targets in 11 games tell a different story. He dealt with some injuries, but the Jaguars will get Marqise Lee back from his torn ACL, and they added Chris Conley, another field-stretcher. They need to find out if he's the guy they thought, so expect him to get the starting nod over Conley, even if it is a run-first offense"
3 weeks ago
236. Michael Badgley K - LAC (at KC)
"The Chargers are loaded with weapons so with Badgley likely getting a full season worth of games, he could very well jump into the top 10 fantasy kickers before long."
9 weeks ago
237. Darren Waller TE - OAK (at DEN)
Waller is becoming a favorite sleeper among analysts in the industry and is flying up draft boards as a result. This freak of nature athlete landed in Jared Cooks role that gave fantasy owners a top 5 fantasy season last year so the upside is enormous.
3 weeks ago
238. Pittsburgh Steelers DST - PIT (at BAL)
239. Cole Beasley WR - BUF (vs . NYJ)
240. Frank Gore RB - BUF (vs . NYJ)
"This seems similar to last year with Gore, as he's going to a new team who has a few other running backs expected to get more playing time. If Gore were going to be behind them, why bring him in at all in free agency? He's likely going to be sharing the workload and should give you 40-60 total yards per game with a very low touchdown ceiling. It's best to let someone else draft the aging veteran"
3 weeks ago
241. Elijah McGuire RB - NYJ (at BUF)
"He's the direct handcuff to Le'Veon Bell, which should carry some value considering Bell hasn't played football in over a year. The issue is that the Jets aren't a very high-scoring offense and have a shoddy offensive line, meaning he'd still be just a mediocre RB3 play even if Bell missed time"
3 weeks ago
242. Tennessee Titans DST - TEN (at HOU)
243. Adam Vinatieri K - IND (at JAC)
Vinatieri doesn't have the leg of a Greg Zuerlein but he does have Andrew Luck and a dome for his home which is an enticing combination for a fantasy kicker.
9 weeks ago
244. Willie Snead WR - BAL (vs . PIT)
"Lamar Jackson is bound to pass the ball much more than last season and while it won't lead to much in the way of fantasy production, his number one receiver may still have some WR5 type value, and more than likely, that player is Snead."
3 weeks ago
245. Indianapolis Colts DST - IND (at JAC)
246. Eli Manning QB - NYG (vs . PHI)
"There's reportedly going to be an open competition for the starting job in New York, though I'm expecting Manning to get the nod. The Giants aren't going anywhere soon and Daniel Jones could use some time with the practice squad before being thrown into game action. The loss of Odell Beckham Jr. is huge, as Manning's splits with/without him are horrifying. He's not even a good selection in 2QB formats due to the fact he'll lose the starting job at some point."
9 weeks ago
247. Cameron Brate TE - TB (vs . ATL)
"He's strictly the backup tight end to O.J. Howard, but that carries some value considering Howard hasn't been able to stay on the field his first two seasons. He'll be useful in streaming situations, as he's now scored at least six touchdowns in each of the last three seasons, but as a backup tight end, he shouldn't be drafted"
3 weeks ago
248. T.J. Yeldon RB - BUF (vs . NYJ)
"Yeldon was someone who had limited option in free agency, but he may have chosen the worst landing spot. Not only do the Bills have LeSean McCoy on the roster, but they signed Frank Gore, then drafted Devin Singletary in the third-round of the NFL Draft. While Yeldon might have a three-down skill-set, he's going to have a hard time being fantasy relevant in that crowded backfield"
3 weeks ago
249. Josh Reynolds WR - LAR (vs . ARI)
250. Tony Pollard RB - DAL (vs . WAS)
"If Zeke holds out, Pollard is the favorite to lead this Cowboys' backfield in touches. He isn't your typical three-down type running back but could contribute similar to what we've seen from Austin Ekeler when Gordon missed time last year. Keep him in mind at the end of your drafts if Zeke is still holding out."
1 week ago
251. Darwin Thompson RB - KC (vs . LAC)
"With Damien Williams already banged up, Carlos Hyde is flying up draft boards but there is an outside chance Thompson proves himself to be the stronger runner and finds his way into the starting lineup before long. As you might expect, he has significant upside because of the offense."
1 week ago
252. Rashard Higgins WR - CLE (at CIN)
253. Jason Myers K - SEA (vs . SF)
"You might not be all that excited about the Seahawks weapons, but the fact of the matter is that their run-heavy offense led to Myers being a top 3 scoring kicker last season in fantasy leagues."
9 weeks ago
254. Kenneth Dixon RB - BAL (vs . PIT)
255. Ryquell Armstead RB - JAC (vs . IND)
"We all know Leonard Fournette has had issues staying on the field, right? Well, the Jaguars have taken notice and drafted Armstead to back him up at the start of the fifth round. He's a big-bodied running back who doesn't avoid contact and may be an injury risk himself due to that. If you're looking for Fournette's handcuff, he's the one you should grab"
3 weeks ago
256. Kansas City Chiefs DST - KC (vs . LAC)
257. Equanimeous St. Brown WR - GB (at DET)
"St. Brown may not even be the #4 receiver this year with Jake Kumerow and J'Mon Moore breathing down his neck, but there is also an outside chance he earns a starting job, perhaps with an injury above him, so that alone makes him worth a late-round gamble."
3 weeks ago
258. Dwayne Haskins QB - WAS (at DAL)
"Haskins is a great buy in SuperFlex dynasty leagues, but we can't be sure he will get the job over Case Keenum to start the season or even at any point this season. Haskins is a polished passer, but if Washington thinks they have a better shot to win with Keenum, they may let Haskins develop behind him. We should know more in the coming weeks about his timeline to start."

259. Keelan Cole WR - JAC (vs . IND)
260. D'Onta Foreman RB - IND (at JAC)
Foreman was cut from the Texans but apparently it had more to do with maturity issues than performance or his achillies recovery. He can safely be avoided even if he signs with another team.

261. Ian Thomas TE - CAR (vs . NO)
262. Jason Witten TE - DAL (vs . WAS)
"Witten is by no means a sexy add at this point in his career, but he'll see enough targets, especially in the red zone, to make him worthy of streaming two or three times this season."

263. Doug Martin RB - OAK (at DEN)
"As soon as Isaiah Crowell went down for the year, the Raiders knew they needed to fill the backup role, so they went out and re-signed Martin, who played well for them last year. He's most definitely the backup to Josh Jacobs, but we mustn't forget that Jacobs never carried the ball more than 100 times in a season while at Alabama, and that the workhorse role is something he may not hold up to. Should he struggle, Martin will have a bigger role than most think"
