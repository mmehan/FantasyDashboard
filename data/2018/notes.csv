Rank,Player,Notes
Tier 1,,
1,Todd Gurley LAR ,"After a historical campaign where he scored 21.3 standard points per game (most since Chris Johnson‘s magical 2009 season), Gurley sits atop the draft rankings. The Rams did go out and acquire Brandin Cooks, but they also re-built their entire defense, which should only lead to more rushing attempts for Gurley. He‘s as safe as they come atop the draft."
2,Le'Veon Bell PIT ,"Despite having a less-successful year than his 2016 campaign, Bell still finished No. 2 among fantasy running backs. His contract dispute is not going away any time soon, which moves him down under Todd Gurley due to safety. We fully expect Bell to suit-up when the lights come on in Week 1, but there‘s always a chance he doesn‘t. Another added risk is that he‘ll have a new offensive coordinator in 2018, though Randy Fichtner doesn‘t appear to be shy running a fast-paced offense."
3,David Johnson ARI ,"Some have Johnson as high as No. 1 in our consensus rankings, but I‘d urge against drafting him with a top-three pick. Did you know that 73.3 percent (22-of-30) of top-six running backs over the last six years have come from top-12 scoring offenses? I‘d argue that the Cardinals would likely be a bottom-10 scoring offense in 2018, and there‘s been just three running backs who have overcome that to become a top-six running back over the last six years. Johnson scored 20 touchdowns in his magical 2016 season, something that‘s not repeatable. It‘s also worth noting that since Week 6 of 2016, he‘s averaged just 3.63 yards per carry on 191 carries. The offensive line wasn‘t great to begin with and they just lost their starting center for the season. He‘s still worth a mid-first-round pick, but I‘d take someone in a better offense over him."
4,Ezekiel Elliott DAL ,"The good news is that the Cowboys offensive line has been replenished in both free agency and the draft. The bad news is that there‘s little talent surrounding Elliott, which could prove to make life difficult on him. While Dez Bryant and Jason Witten weren‘t in their primes, they demanded attention from opposing defensive coordinators. Unfortunately, Terrance Williams and Allen Hurns don‘t. Elliott will get all the work he can handle, which is important but just how efficient can he be?"
5,Antonio Brown PIT ,"My overall ranking might be too low on the No. 1 wide receiver who has now finished inside the top-three at his position in each of the last four years, but passing on a volume running back is hard to do. Brown is as consistent as they come, as he‘s now posted at least WR2 numbers in 57 of his last 77 games, which amounts to 74 percent of the time. The only wide receivers who were able to accomplish that in just one year (2017) were Deandre Hopkins and Michael Thomas. He‘s the No. 1 wide receiver and it‘s not even debatable at this point. He‘s like a fine wine that gets better with age."
6,DeAndre Hopkins HOU ,"There are a lot of fantasy football owners going gaga over Hopkins in 2018, but I‘d warn you to proceed with caution. Not only did the Texans throw a lot more than they wanted to in 2017 because of all the injuries on the defensive side of the ball, but the 9.3 percent touchdown rate by Deshaun Watson is completely inflated. While Hopkins remains one of the safest wide receivers due to his volume, you don‘t want to pay for last year‘s performance. Don‘t forget that he finished as the WR36 in 2016 while seeing 151 targets. I get it, Watson is better than what he‘s had, but temper those expectations."
7,Alvin Kamara NO ,"Did you know that Kamara scored more fantasy points on just his receiving totals than Amari Cooper, Sammy Watkins, and Jordy Nelson did in 2017? His 826 yards and five touchdowns would‘ve ranked 24th among wide receivers. We‘re talking about a running back. Even if we dial back some of his efficiency, the suspension of Mark Ingram can give him some touches to help compensate. It‘s only natural that a player going into year two would receive more touches, anyway."
Tier 2,,
8,Odell Beckham Jr. NYG ,"It‘s now a 47-game sample size, so we have plenty of data to analyze him against. Beckham Jr. has posted WR1 numbers in 48.9 percent of those games, which is simply ridiculous. Just how ridiculous? Well, the closest wide receiver to his totals over the last 15 years is Julio Jones, who has hit the WR1 mark in 40.4 percent of his games. The addition of Saquon Barkley is likely to take away some of his massive potential, but he‘s still a generational talent that is going to be heavily involved."
9,Saquon Barkley NYG ,"When a team selects a running back with the No. 2 overall pick in today‘s game, they‘re going to use him, a lot. Last year in Pat Shurmur‘s offense, then-rookie Dalvin Cook totaled 71 touches in the team‘s first three games before getting hurt in Week 4. His pace was 379 total touches, which would have ranked No. 2 behind only Todd Gurley. Unlike Ezekiel Elliott, Barkley won‘t even be the opponent‘s biggest fear as long as Odell Beckham Jr. is on the field."
10,Julio Jones ATL ,"If you‘re fortunate to land Jones late in the first, consider yourself one lucky person. While some have said he‘s inconsistent, the numbers tell a different story. He‘s finished with WR1 numbers in 40.4 percent of his career games, which ranks second to only Odell Beckham Jr. since 2001. If you think he‘s too “boom or bust,"" the only players who have posted a higher WR3 percentage than his (73.4 percent) are Beckham Jr., Antonio Brown, A.J. Green, and Michael Thomas. He‘s a stud who is due for some positive touchdown regression. He might be the only one who can compete with Brown for the top wide receiver spot."
11,Michael Thomas NO ,"What Thomas lacked in upside in 2017, he made up for with consistency, as he was finished with WR2 or better numbers 75 percent of the time, which ranked second to only Deandre Hopkins. Should some of Alvin Kamara‘s regression go Thomas’ way, you‘ll be getting a steal in the second-round, as he‘ll finish as a top-five wide receiver. Most don‘t realize that he finished top-eight last year despite scoring just five times. As long as Drew Brees is his quarterback, Thomas is worth a top-20 pick in any format."
12,Kareem Hunt KC ,"Last offseason, I was telling fantasy players to draft both Spencer Ware and Kareem Hunt (when they were both going outside the top seven rounds) because you were guaranteed RB1 production out of one of them. When Ware went down, I pounded the table for Hunt as a late second-round pick under Andy Reid. He ran with the job, so he‘s the clear-cut starter for them in 2018, and it‘s a team who packs some serious offensive firepower, provided Pat Mahomes is the real deal. There‘s tons of mouths to feed between Hunt, Sammy Watkins, Tyreek Hill, and Travis Kelce, but I‘ll remind you that you want Reid‘s starting running back no matter who it is. Hunt just happened to show you that he‘s an above average running back last year, breaking an NFL-high 19 runs of more than 15 yards. They accounted for 521 yards, or 39.3 percent of his season total."
13,Melvin Gordon LAC ,"After a disappointing rookie campaign, Gordon has been among the most consistent running backs in fantasy football the last two years, posting RB2 or better numbers in 24-of-29 games. His durability is a concern, though, as he missed five games over his first two years, and parts of others in 2017. The Chargers figure to be a high-scoring team once again in 2018, which bodes well for his chances of finishing as a top-12 running back for the third straight season."
14,Keenan Allen LAC ,"After starting out the season extremely slow (595 yards, one touchdown through the first nine games), Allen exploded over the final seven games of the season, posting 798 yards and five touchdowns. His emergence came as the team started to move away from Antonio Gates, who is no longer with the team in 2018. The concern with him is that Mike Williams (who they drafted in the top-10 last year) will see much more playing time and is a real red zone threat, though the loss of Hunter Henry definitely clears up some targets. Allen has been a fantasy asset when he‘s on the field, so there‘s little reason to doubt him now."
15,Leonard Fournette JAC ,"If we could guarantee that Fournette would stay on the field for all 16 games, he‘d be worthy of a top-five pick, but his foot troubles are a concern. Not only did Blake Bortles start to play competently toward the end of the season, but the Jaguars added Andrew Norwell in free agency, who is one of the best offensive guards in football. Fournette should see some lighter fronts en route to another top-10 finish."
16,Dalvin Cook MIN ,"After totaling 71 touches over the first three games, Cook didn‘t get to show us much of a sample size, though what we did see looked promising. One downfall is that Pat Shurmur is no longer calling plays for the Vikings, though some are excited to see what Joe DiFilippo can do in that role. Still, the defense is as good as ever, which is only good news for Cook‘s projected attempts. After analyzing the strength of schedule in our own way, Cook had the best schedule among all running backs."
17,A.J. Green CIN ,"Over Green‘s career, he‘s posted WR3 or better numbers in 76.2 percent of his games. The only wide receivers who have better numbers over their careers are Michael Thomas and Odell Beckham Jr. Despite the Bengals offense being extremely underwhelming in 2017, Green still somehow managed to finish top-10 for the fourth time in the last six years. He may never make it to the top-three, but he‘s consistent enough to warrant a second-round pick."
18,Davante Adams GB ,"After many wrote him off after his first two seasons, Adams has top-three wide receiver in his range of possibilities in 2018. I mean, the guy finished as a top-12 wide receiver with Brett Hundley starting the majority of the season. He‘ll now be the No. 1 wide receiver for Aaron Rodgers, which makes him as safe as they come at the position. He‘s scored 17 touchdowns in his last 22 games with Rodgers under center."
Tier 3,,
19,Devonta Freeman ATL ,"Freeman has lost some of his luster with Tevin Coleman becoming more and more involved, but he‘s still a fantasy producer. The reason to be pessimistic about him, though, is that he received 12 or fewer carries in eight of his final 10 games in 2017. That‘s going to make it tough to produce as the top-10 running back that he is, though his work in the receiving game helps. He doesn‘t have top-three upside as long as Coleman is healthy, but he‘ll likely produce as an RB2 or better the majority of time."
20,Mike Evans TB ,"Anyone who drafted Evans last year has a bad taste in their mouth, though we‘ve always said that touchdowns are the hardest thing to predict, even when you‘re 6-foot-5 and 231 pounds. Evans now has two 12 touchdown seasons under his belt, but the other two netted a combined eight touchdowns. Still, he‘s now produced 1,000 yards in each of his four seasons, which is something you need to value. If Jameis Winston takes a step forward in his career, Evans could be right back in the first-round conversation next year."
21,Christian McCaffrey CAR ,"The signing of C.J. Anderson most definitely hurt McCaffrey‘s upside in the Panthers offense, but they weren‘t going to give him 200 carries regardless of that (yes, I know what Norv Turner said about 25-30 touches per game - he‘s nuts). McCaffrey‘s not designed to handle that type of work and Ron Rivera has acknowledged that after Week 1 of last season, so I‘m not sure where this is coming from. It also doesn‘t help that Greg Olsen is back to soak up a lot of targets (averaged 125 targets/year prior to getting hurt in 2017), as is newly-drafted D.J. Moore. While they won‘t erase what McCaffrey has done for this offense, it‘s unlikely he sees 113 targets again. Think of him as an Alvin Kamara-lite version whose ceiling may be around the RB10 range in standard formats."
22,Rob Gronkowski NE ,"Target for target, Gronk is the best tight end in football (well except for Hunter Henry—not joking). With that said, we all know his problems staying healthy. It used to be the case that we had to roll the dice anyway because he was far and away the best tight end. That isn‘t true anymore, as both Ertz and Kelce are right on his back. It may be in your best interest to let someone else risk losing their season by drafting an oft-injured tight end in the second or third round."
23,Jerick McKinnon SF ,"No matter how you feel about McKinnon‘s talent, the 49ers have told you everything you need to know when they paid him $30 million over four years. You should know that the 49ers could get out of the contract after one year with just a $1.5 million cap hit in 2019, but that‘s not why you sign someone like him. They also passed on a lot of running backs in the draft, showing confidence in the guys on the roster. He‘s never been great on first- and second-down, but unless you believe Matt Breida or Joe Williams is going to walk into 15 carries per game, you need to rank McKinnon aggressively. He figures to be the Devonta Freeman of Kyle Shanahan‘s offense, which we know is extremely valuable."
24,Jordan Howard CHI ,"In standard formats, feel free to draft Howard in the second-round, as he‘s going to be the workhorse on first- and second-down for new head coach Matt Nagy, who comes from Andy Reid‘s tutelage. Howard has been one of the most reliable runners in football the last two years, averaging 4.61 yards per carry while the defense knew exactly what they were doing, with no other real threat on the field for a majority of those games. His lack of passing-down work limits his upside, but he‘s extremely safe in standard because there isn‘t another running back on the roster who can net 200-plus carries."
25,T.Y. Hilton IND ,"It‘s very possible that Hilton moves down depending on how Andrew Luck looks this preseason (really hoping to see him play in those weeks), but I‘m remaining optimistic for the time-being. During the time he played with Luck, Hilton finished in-between the WR5 and WR24 range every season. He‘s not someone you draft for consistency, however, as he‘s posted WR2 or better numbers in just 42.6 percent of his career games."
26,Adam Thielen MIN ,"Most don‘t realize how much of an effect that Pat Shurmur had on Thielen‘s career, as he catapulted him into a household fantasy name. He was 26 years old when he broke out, something that doesn‘t happen all that often. The move to John DiFilippo will change some things, as will the move to Kirk Cousins, who has taken more chances down the field than game-manager Case Keenum did. That would play more into Stefon Diggs’ skill-set rather than Thielen‘s. I do expect him to be a reliable fantasy producer, but he‘s not going to finish with 143 targets again."
27,Doug Baldwin SEA ,"While everyone seems to be foaming at the mouth to draft Rashaad Penny, it‘s Baldwin who is the most valuable asset on the Seahawks roster. It‘s rare to find a wide receiver who is as underappreciated as Baldwin, who has now finished as a top-13 wide receiver in each of the last three seasons. Not only has he averaged 1,062.7 yards in that span, but he‘s scored 29 touchdowns, and that was with Jimmy Graham on the roster. I shouldn‘t have to remind you that Graham is gone, and the Seahawks didn‘t add a wide receiver of significance to replace Paul Richardson. Baldwin is a low-end WR1 with upside. You should know that Baldwin suffered some sort of knee injury at the start of training camp and is expected to miss the preseason games. While he doesn‘t necessarily need the work as a veteran, it‘s added risk to his fantasy appeal."
28,Travis Kelce KC ,"Not only has Kelce missed just one game in four seasons, but he also has more yards than Gronk in that time. The reason I do not have him over Ertz is that I am of the party who believes Pat Mahomes is a major step back from Alex Smith. Last season, Smith was among the most efficient passers in the league on both deep balls and short passes. Mahomes has played one game so I‘m unwilling to buy into him on the same level as an MVP candidate like Smith, and that means I‘ll be cautious with his assets as well."
29,Joe Mixon CIN ,"Most have somehow forgotten how highly-touted Mixon was coming out of Oklahoma. He‘s a true three-down workhorse running back that can handle 20-plus touches per game if they want him to, and that‘s exactly how they treated him once Jeremy Hill went down last year, as he averaged 17.6 touches per game from Week 8-12 before he hurt his ankle in Week 13. Those 17.6 touches per game would‘ve ranked as the 13th most among running backs last year. If the Bengals can become a competent offense once again after rebuilding the offensive line, Mixon has top-five upside."
30,Stefon Diggs MIN ,"The addition of Kirk Cousins has everyone excited, though the one who should be most excited is Diggs, who might see more targets float his way. After playing with Case Keenum, who was more of a game manager, Diggs should be more of a field stretcher for Cousins, as he can create separation at every level of the field. Meanwhile, Adam Thielen had a boost in production under Pat Shurmur, who is now gone. As of now, Thielen is going earlier than Diggs in drafts, but it really should be the other way around. Take the discount on Diggs and pass on Thielen."
31,Larry Fitzgerald ARI ,"I‘m done trying to predict when father time will catch up with Fitzgerald, as it seemed like he was on his way out in 2014, only he has since posted WR11, WR17, and WR9 seasons (in standard formats). The quarterback position arguably upgraded with Sam Bradford and Josh Rosen this offseason, though the offense is going to look different under head coach Steve Wilks. There‘s still not another player on this team who sniffs Fitzgerald‘s level of talent at wide receiver, so I‘d fully expect another top-24 season out of him."
32,Tyreek Hill KC ,"It‘s clear that Tyreek Hill is among the most efficient wide receivers in the game, as his 11.3 yards per target in 2017 ranked first in the league among those with 70 or more targets. Not just that, but the closest player to him was Marvin Jones at 10.3 YPT (a whopping 9 percent difference). That number came up quite a bit from his 2016 total that was at 7.1 yards per target, so you might want to dial back those large expectations. The addition of Sammy Watkins isn‘t going to help him gain a higher target share, either, as they paid Watkins a generous $50 million. As high as you might be on Pat Mahomes, it‘s going to be incredibly hard for him to top Alex Smith‘s MVP-caliber 2017 season. There‘s regression coming for Hill, but his price does not reflect that."
Tier 4,,
33,Amari Cooper OAK ,"After posting back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons to open his career, Cooper hit some speed bumps in 2017, as he finished with just 680 yards in 14 games. It was even worse than that, though, as he accumulated 30.9 percent of his yardage in just one game. We do know that his ankle caused him to miss nearly two full games, but it‘s rare to see a wide receiver struggle the way he did when coming off two impressive seasons. It may not have helped that Derek Carr was dealing with a back injury as well, so we‘ll chalk that season up to an outlier in what‘s been a great start to a career. The Raiders cut Michael Crabtree, which helps, but then brought in both Jordy Nelson and Martavis Bryant to replenish the weaponry. Still, Cooper is the only one who has rapport with his quarterback, so I‘d expect him to bounce back to WR2 status in 2018."
34,Demaryius Thomas DEN ,"It‘s become the cool thing to avoid Thomas in drafts, and there‘s good reason for that. He‘s been trending in the wrong direction since Peyton Manning retired, finishing as the WR13, WR19, and then the WR23 in 2017. The impressive part is his consistency, despite the inconsistency from the quarterback position. The addition of Case Keenum will help more than it‘ll hurt, so find it in your heart to welcome Thomas into your WR2 slot, as he offers more safety than most taken in this range."
35,LeSean McCoy BUF ,"I‘m not completely sold on drafting McCoy as a top-12 running back, but it‘s hard to pass on the volume he‘ll receive this year. Playing on a team with what‘s likely to have a rookie under center, behind a now-poor offensive line (lost three starters this offseason), in what‘s almost guaranteed to be a low-scoring offense? Did I mention that he‘s going to be 30 years old when the season starts? You can‘t pass up this type of volume in the second-round, but I wouldn‘t blame you if you took a wide receiver over him where he‘s being drafted. As an update, you might be wise pushing McCoy out into the eighth-round, as there could be a looming suspension for some off-the-field acquisitions. You simply cannot risk taking him in the first few rounds with those question marks."
36,Zach Ertz PHI ,"You may not believe this, but Ertz has three consecutive seasons with more receptions than Gronk. With Trey Burton gone and a full season of Carson Wentz, I have no problem taking Ertz even before Gronk and Kelce this season. He has only missed five games in five seasons. Meanwhile, Gronk has missed at least five games in four of his eight career seasons."
37,Allen Robinson CHI ,"It typically takes some time for a wide receiver to learn a new offense, which puts him behind where the rest of the wide receiver group is, but Robinson doesn‘t have to worry about that, as they are all learning a new offense. In fact, the starting trio of wide receivers and tight end will all be new faces for Mitch Trubisky. You don‘t bring in someone like Robinson in free agency if you aren‘t going to feature him. I‘m expecting a minimum of 120 targets, which essentially locks him in as a top-25 wide receiver, as there were no wide receivers with more than 109 targets who finished outside the top-25 in standard formats."
38,Alex Collins BAL ,"A lot of people talk about how good Kenyan Drake was to close out the season, but did you know that Collins was the RB8 in standard formats from Week 8 through Week 17? He was better for a longer stretch, and the offense improved significantly around him this offseason. The only concern you‘d have is Kenneth Dixon, who was supposed to be the team‘s workhorse, but it‘s possible that they‘re going to simply move on from him. That built-in risk lowers him on my board just a tad, but I don‘t think the Ravens would‘ve re-signed him if that were the case. An update on Dixon is that he‘s been missing camp with a soft tissue injury, which should give you more confidence in Collins as the team‘s clear-cut workhorse."
39,Aaron Rodgers GB ,"The best in the game, period. By ranking him in the 30-40 range overall, I know that he‘s unlikely to fall to me in drafts, but that‘s because of how replaceable the position really is. The dip from Rodgers to someone like Matthew Stafford is typically four points per game, which is a much larger gap from someone like Melvin Gordon down to someone like Giovani Bernard. If Rodgers falls to the end of the third-round, that‘s when I‘d start to consider him."
40,Golden Tate DET ,"I get it, Tate isn‘t a sexy pick that‘ll win you your fantasy league, but he‘s now finished as a top-34 receiver in each of the last six seasons, including a WR19 finish last year while Marvin Jones had a miraculous season. With the exit of Eric Ebron, some targets may open up over the middle of the field, while Jones now has to fight for perimeter targets with Kenny Golladay. Tate‘s role in the offense is safe, as he‘s now seen at least 120 targets in each of the last four seasons."
41,Alshon Jeffery PHI ,"Did you realize that Jeffery had just a 47.5 percent catch rate in 2017? That ranked 168th of the 211 wide receivers who saw at least one target in 2018. To know that he finished as the WR15 despite that is pretty amazing. The chemistry between him and Carson Wentz should grow as time goes on, though his touchdown rate will likely go down with Wentz‘s. Still, Jeffery is the clear-cut No. 1 receiver in an offense with a creative play-caller and franchise quarterback. His injury-riddled past is factored in, as he‘d be higher on my list if he hadn‘t missed 11 games in the past three years with a lot of soft tissue injuries."
42,Kenyan Drake MIA ,"The stretch that Drake had at the end of 2017 was nothing short of impressive. He was playing on a bad team, but finished as the RB8 during Weeks 13-17. We mustn‘t forget that Damien Williams was also hurt during most of that time, so it allowed him to receive more touches than usual. Williams is gone, but the Dolphins brought in Frank Gore, who didn‘t come to collect dust, and drafted Kalen Ballage, a receiving specialist. There‘s reasons to like Drake, but there are equally as many reasons not to. The first depth chart out of Miami had Drake and Gore listed as co-starters, though Drake is expected to receive the majority of touches."
43,Derrius Guice WAS ,"As you can see by the rest of my rankings, I‘m not shy when it comes to betting on a rookie running back. After watching him fall in the draft for “character concerns,"" the Redskins pounced on a running back they had a first-round grade on. While Guice isn‘t going to steal the third-down work from Chris Thompson, he‘s going to be “the man” they turn to on early downs. That role was occupied by a combination of Samaje Perine and Rob Kelley last year, who combined for 237 carries. If you‘re worried about Perine or Kelley, don‘t be. You don‘t spend a second-round pick on a running back if you have someone that you kind of like. As for Chris Thompson, he‘ll have a role, but he‘s still recovering from a broken fibula in November of last year. Guice could come out of the gate guns blazing."
44,JuJu Smith-Schuster PIT ,"Fun fact: Smith-Schuster ranked 55th among wide receivers in targets per game. His 5.6 targets per game ranked behind guys like Kendall Wright and Danny Amendola. His 11.6 yards per target was the best among wide receivers with at least 25 targets, and in fact, it was the best in the last five years. He‘s going to regress there and the offense didn‘t change drastically from last year to this year, so seeing his targets make a huge jump is unlikely. We‘ve seen the upside he presents, but that was his absolute ceiling given the opportunities he‘s capped at. You can‘t draft a wide receiver who ranked 55th in targets per game in the top-five rounds of your fantasy draft, you just can‘t."
45,Jay Ajayi PHI ,"I know that by ranking Ajayi outside the top-24 running backs, he won‘t wind up on any of my teams, and that‘s something I‘m okay with. Doug Pederson has shown us that he wants to use a committee approach in his offense, He topped 34 snaps just once during his time with the Eagles, with none of the final four games netting any more than 30 snaps. When you‘re playing that many snaps, your upside goes out the window and you‘ll be extremely touchdown dependent. With Darren Sproles returning and Corey Clement showing off late in the season, there‘s no reason to expect it to change. He‘s going to be frustrating to own."
46,Marvin Jones DET ,"After seeing 107 targets in 2017, Jones’ incredible touchdown rate propped him all the way up to the WR5 in standard leagues. He caught a touchdown once every 11.9 targets, which is almost double the average rate for wide receivers, which stands at one every 22.8 targets. After scoring just four touchdowns the prior season in the same offense, you have to wonder just how sustainable his touchdown total is. On top of that, the Lions continue to hype up Kenny Golladay, who is another big-bodied wide receiver to take away some of those looks. Jones is a solid fantasy asset, but don‘t pay for last year‘s numbers. He averaged just 5.3 targets per game with Golladay in the lineup, but 9.8 targets per game when he was held out."
47,Jarvis Landry CLE ,"Going from 140-plus targets to one where he will have a tough time seeing 110 targets is a very big deal for someone like Landry. While I believe he‘s a better football player than what the Dolphins used him as, he‘s going to play a similar role on the Browns, as Josh Gordon and Corey Coleman are more of the field-stretchers. Knowing that Landry has averaged 7.08 yards per target over his career, his 110 targets would amount to just under 800 yards, and we know he isn‘t scoring more than six touchdowns. He‘s just a WR4 in standard leagues if Gordon gets back on the field. If Gordon does miss any time, you should feel comfortable trotting Landry out as a solid WR3."
48,Brandin Cooks LAR ,"While many continue to prop Cooks up as a low-end WR1, I urge you to stay away from that territory when it comes to him. The Sean McVay offense doesn‘t cater to one wide receiver, and it‘s unlikely they take targets away from Robert Woods and Cooper Kupp, who were both extremely efficient last season. We saw Sammy Watkins finish with 70 targets in this exact role last year, and that was despite them giving up a second-round pick to acquire him. While I‘d expect Cooks to see more than that with a full offseason to work with the offense, it‘d be a stretch to see him finish with anything more than 100 targets. There were just three wide receivers who finished top-24 last year with less than 100 targets, so while it‘s doable, it‘s not a given."
49,Josh Gordon CLE ,"It didn‘t seem like Gordon missed a beat upon his return last year, though the quarterback play was less than ideal. 39 percent of his targets were over 20 yards, though just 5-of-16 were catchable. It goes to show that the Browns want to use him down the field, though there‘s bound to be some changes with Todd Haley taking over as coordinator. The reason I‘m down on Gordon, though, is that they brought in Tyrod Taylor, Carlos Hyde, Nick Chubb, and Jarvis Landry this offseason. That screams, “we want to run a ball-control style offense."" There‘s only so many targets to go around, so by drafting Gordon as a top-24 receiver, you‘re essentially saying that Landry is likely to cap out around 100 targets. On top of the target risk, Gordon is now away from the team for training camp, which cannot bode well for him learning the new offense and developing chemistry with his new quarterbacks."
50,Derrick Henry TEN ,"After sharing a backfield with DeMarco Murray the last two years, Henry seemed to have the backfield all to himself once they released Murray this offseason. Instead, they upgraded Murray when they snagged Dion Lewis, who is one of the best pass-blockers in the game and one they paid $20 million to over four years. It‘s clear that they want Henry to remain in the role he was last year, which netted him 11.7 touches per game (ranked just 42nd among RBs). While I suspect he‘ll get a small bump, he‘s not likely to get into the 15-16-touch range, which is what‘s often required to finish as a top-15 running back. He‘s going to be touchdown-dependent, something that isn‘t ideal for someone who costs a third-round pick."
51,Lamar Miller HOU ,"There were rumors that the Texans may cut Miller this offseason, but nothing ever came to fruition, as it‘s possible that D‘Onta Foreman starts the season on the PUP list after his Achilles injury last year. If that‘s the case, Miller should move up even further on my list, as he‘s one of the few running backs who‘ve consistently seen 250-plus touches over the last four years. If Deshaun Watson can be even half the quarterback he was last year, Miller is going to find himself going against a lot of light defensive fronts, which could be the reason he averaged 14.9 PPR points per game with Watson, compared to just 9.9 PPR points per game with Tom Savage."
Tier 5,,
52,Russell Wilson SEA ,"Once you get down to around the No. 50 overall pick, the sure things are gone, so why not take one of the elite players at his position? Wilson has now finished as a top-three quarterback in three of the last four seasons and has never fallen out of the top-12 quarterbacks in any of his six seasons. His defense is as bad as its ever been, which should force him to partake in some shootouts that never seemed to happen before. Despite the elite defense that was being played, Wilson has posted QB1 numbers in 47.9 percent of his games, including a career-high 68.8 percent of games in 2017. He offers safety and upside, which is rare at the position."
53,Dion Lewis TEN ,"You should be expecting Lewis to walk right into the old DeMarco Murray role of the offense, as you don‘t go out and sign a running back in free agency for $20 million for no reason. It‘s possible that new offensive coordinator Matt LaFleur simply didn‘t want Derrick Henry to be “the guy” of the offense, as he‘s not a great pass-catcher. If LaFleur installs an offense similar to the one Sean McVay used in L.A., then Lewis could turn out to be a steal at his current cost."
54,Mark Ingram NO ,"He‘s suspended for the first four games of the season, sure, but getting him for 12 games will be more valuable than someone like Derrick Henry, who will be touchdown-reliant in all 16 games. It‘s clear that the Saints don‘t want to shift more of the early-down work to Alvin Kamara, as Sean Payton said they don‘t want to change his workload much, even during the first four weeks while Ingram is out. Ingram is also due for some positive regression in the touchdown department, as he caught 58 passes last year without a single touchdown. The league average among running backs is one every 25.6 receptions."
55,Tom Brady NE ,"It‘s really only a matter of time before Brady starts the inevitable downturn to his Hall of Fame career, and we may have already started to witness the beginning of the end. After throwing 26 touchdowns and just three interceptions in the first 11 games, Brady threw just six touchdowns with five interceptions over the final five games, and failed to top 15 fantasy points in any of them. He still gets the benefit of the doubt, but I wouldn‘t go out of my way to draft him."
56,Rashaad Penny SEA ,"There are a lot of people high on the Seahawks rookie running back who was selected at the end of the first-round, though I‘m not really one of them. Don‘t get me wrong, he‘s likely going to finish as a top-24 running back, but playing behind the Seahawks offensive line won‘t do him any favors. Of the three running backs who had the most carries without a touchdown last year, two Seahawks running backs made the list: Eddie Lacy (75 carries) and Thomas Rawls (67 carries). He‘s going to get a lot of work, so don‘t shy away from him, but I also wouldn‘t aggressively go after him knowing that outside of Marshawn Lynch three years ago, no Seahawks running back has had a great deal of success. They‘ve also been talking about Chris Carson quite a bit. While I don‘t think he starts over Penny, he‘s clearly part of their plans."
57,Michael Crabtree BAL ,"After seeing 291 targets over a two year period with the Raiders, Crabtree saw that number drop to just 101 targets in 2017. Fortunately for him, he was released and wound up as the No. 1 receiver on another team that should get him somewhere in the range of 110-120 targets. Some will say more than that, but Joe Flacco doesn‘t heavily target any one receiver. During his 10 years in the league, he‘s yet to target one more than 137 times, and that includes two seasons with 610-plus attempts. He‘s a safe WR3 who may give you WR2 production."
58,Royce Freeman DEN ,"Another rookie running back? Yep. While there are some who are worried about Devontae Booker, you shouldn‘t be one of them. He legitimately played behind the running back they just cut (C.J. Anderson), so what makes you think he‘d start in front of a guy they just spent a high third-round pick on? Freeman may not be elite at anything, but he‘s really good at everything. He‘s a no-nonsense runner who knows how to follow his blocks, similar to Jordan Howard. In an offense that likely takes a step forward, Freeman should finish as a top-24 running back in his first season."
59,Greg Olsen CAR ,"Olsen is risky, there is no doubt about that, but let‘s not forget that Olsen had over 3,000 yards in the three seasons prior to his injury-riddled 2017 and that he dominated in the NFL playoffs. He had never missed a game until last season so it isn‘t as though you should suddenly excpect him to be injury prone."
60,Cam Newton CAR ,"After the failed experiment of trying to dial back Newton‘s rushing attempts in 2016, it was good to see them unleash him again in 2017. If you take away Newton‘s ability to run, he wouldn‘t be a quarterback in this league very long. Fortunately, it seems the Panthers figured that out, making Newton an elite fantasy option once again, rushing for a career-high 754 yards. The upgraded weaponry around him doesn‘t hurt, either."
61,Corey Davis TEN ,"Davis is someone I compared to Brandon Marshall during last year‘s draft process, and after watching him throughout the 2017 season, my expectations haven‘t changed. He didn‘t develop any chemistry with Marcus Mariota until playoff time, where he caught nine passes for 98 yards and two touchdowns in their two games. He‘s still yet to “prove it,"" so you don‘t want to go all-in, but the potential is there for a top-15 season."
62,Deshaun Watson HOU ,"Just how unrepeatable was Watson‘s 2017 season? Well, since 2000, just four other quarterbacks have thrown a touchdown on more than 7.9 percent of their passes. We‘re talking about the entire careers of Peyton Manning, Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers, Drew Brees, Ben Roethlisberger, and Philip Rivers. Watson‘s rate was 9.3 percent in 2017. Looking at all quarterbacks in 2017, only he and Carson Wentz threw a touchdown on more than 6.7 percent of their attempts, which should give you all you need to know. In fact, you should expect his touchdown percentage to be cut in half (and it‘d still be good). He‘s still among the top quartebacks because of his rushing ability, but don‘t pay for last year‘s production, which was still just six games worth."
63,Sammy Watkins KC ,"It wouldn‘t shock me to see Watkins finish as the best Chiefs wide receiver, as I believe he‘s the most talented one. The issue is that he‘s learning his third offense in three years, which can cripple a wide receiver in year-one. Because of that, Tyreek Hill is the preferred option in 2018. Still, the Chiefs didn‘t pay Watkins $50 million to see 60-80 targets, so I‘d expect him to be a WR3 more often than not. With Pat Mahomes under center and a bad defense, the recipe is there for increased pass attempts."
64,Chris Hogan NE ,"Despite playing in just nine games in 2017, Hogan managed to finish tied for 25th in red zone targets, and actually had the same amount that Brandin Cooks (12) did, despite Cooks playing all 16 games. It goes to show the confidence Tom Brady has developed with him, so by taking Hogan where he‘s currently going in drafts, you‘re getting WR2 upside at WR4/WR5 cost."
65,Evan Engram NYG ,"If you think Engram will see 115 targets with Odell Beckham back in the lineup and Saquon Barkley joining the fold then you‘ve got a big surprise coming. Chances are, he won‘t even see 90, and considering he‘s got some of the worst hands at the position, Engram may end up being the biggest disappointment at the position."
66,Ronald Jones II TB ,"Not only have I been bullish on rookie running backs, but I‘m bullish on the Bucs offense as a whole. When you have the firepower of Mike Evans, Desean Jackson, Chris Godwin, O.J. Howard, and Cameron Brate in front of you, it‘s not likely that a defense will ever make it their priority to stop the running back. Those who are concerned about Peyton Barber shouldn‘t be, as the Bucs would‘ve just snagged one of the free agent running backs available to pair with him. Instead, they used a high second-round pick on the running back who has a similar style to Jamaal Charles. Playing in what could be a top-five scoring offense is never a bad thing."
67,Pierre Garcon SF ,"After seemingly walking into 140 targets with the 49ers when he signed in free agency, Garcon all of a sudden has plenty of competition for targets. From Marquise Goodwin, to George Kittle, to Jerick McKinnon, and now recently-drafted Dante Pettis. He totaled 67 targets over the first eight games last year which would have put him on pace for 134, though you shouldn‘t be expecting more than 110 this season, and possibly less."
68,Emmanuel Sanders DEN ,"It‘s very possible that Sanders outperforms my ranking of him, but he‘s now 31 years old and has started to show signs of slowing down, whether it be age or injuries. His yards per target has declined each of the last three seasons, bottoming out at 6.0 yards in 2017. The upgrade in quarterback should help, though, as he was still averaging 7.7 targets per game, which ranked 17th among wide receivers. He should be considered a solid WR4 with some upside."
69,Jimmy Graham GB ,"Graham may have played 16 games each of the past two seasons, but let‘s not be so quick to forget that he is still dealing with a significant shoulder injury that will likely linger the remainder of his career. Graham only had 520 receiving yards last season and even with Aaron Rodgers, 10 touchdowns will be tough to repeat with just a 59% catch rate and 50ish receptions."
70,Sony Michel NE ,"One of the interesting stats I‘ve come across through my offseason research was that rookie running backs who were drafted in the first-round over the last six years finish as a RB1 80 percent of the time. While it‘s a very small sample size, it just goes to show that when a team invests a first-round pick on a running back, you shouldn‘t be afraid to roster him. On top of that, he plays for a team that‘s finished top-three in scoring in every season since 2010. Seriously, that‘s ridiculous. There are only two things that could get in Michel‘s way: Fumbles, so please, protect the ball. The other is injury, which no one is immune to. Michel actually needed a small procedure on his knee that knocked him out of training camp for two weeks, so he may be in somewhat of a timeshare to start the season."
71,Drew Brees NO ,"Since 2008, Brees’ touchdown rate had been 5.0 percent or higher, which was the reason he threw for at least 32 touchdowns in each of those seasons. In 2017, however, that number dipped to 4.3 percent. Was it Brees slipping? Well, when you look at his record-setting completion percentage (72.0 percent), highest yards per attempt since 2011 (8.1), and lowest interception rate in his entire career (1.5 percent), my answer would be an emphatic “no."" The touchdowns will come back, as will the pass attempts, and Brees will likely be one of the steals in fantasy drafts."
72,Robert Woods LAR ,"As it turns out, coaching does, in fact, matter more than most care to admit. After failing to finish as a top-40 wide receiver in any of his first four seasons, Woods finished as the WR33 in 2017 despite missing four games! His 85 targets over 12 games would extrapolate to 113.3 over a full 16-game season, though we can‘t automatically pencil him in for that with the arrival of Brandin Cooks. With the way their defense improved, it‘s unlikely that they‘ll be throwing any more in 2018, so you have to keep your expectations at bay with Woods. He‘s likely to be on the WR3/WR4 border most weeks and offers little upside with all the playmakers on that offense."
73,Rex Burkhead NE ,"It seemed things were looking up for Burkhead after the Patriots let Dion Lewis walked and then signed the plodding Jeremy Hill to replace him. That didn‘t last long, as the Patriots snagged three-down running back Sony Michel at the end of the first-round, showing just how much they felt it was a need. Burkhead is likely to stay in the role he had last year, though the production should dip, as he scored a touchdown on a league-leading 8.5 percent of his touches. By comparison, the NFL average for running backs is 2.85 percent. Still, Burkhead makes for a solid flex-option who has RB2 potential if Michel doesn‘t pan out."
74,Delanie Walker TEN ,"It is difficult to be excited about someone like Walker, but there is something to be said about his consistency and reliability. Walker has been a top eight tight end each of the past four seasons and is showing no signs of slowing down. He has seen at least 100 targets in each of those four seasons and is due for positive touchdown regression in 2018."
75,Tevin Coleman ATL ,"Unless there‘s an injury to Devonta Freeman, it‘s hard to see Coleman living up to his current ADP, which is right around the 22nd-24th RB off the board. In games where Freeman‘s played all four quarters, Coleman topped 11 carries just once last season. When seeing in between 6-11 carries per game, it makes it difficult to produce massive numbers unless you‘re consistently scoring touchdowns at an unsustainable rate, which Coleman has. The reason you draft him is because he can give you flex-type production with Freeman, but turns into a must-start RB1 without Freeman."
76,Carson Wentz PHI ,"To give you an idea as to how unrepeatable Wentz‘s 2017 season was from a touchdown standpoint, let‘s compare him to Aaron Rodgers. Wentz‘s touchdown rate was 7.5 percent last year, a number that Rodgers has hit just once in his career. Remember, we are talking about the guy who I‘d consider the best of all-time. If we dialed back his touchdown rate to 6.0 percent, which is still elite, he would‘ve thrown seven less touchdowns, which would drop him from the QB5 to QB12. Coming off an ACL tear may limit his mobility at the start of the season, which further impacts his fantasy performance. I‘d avoid him as a top-five quarterback off the board, especially knowing that he‘s unlikely to play in any preseason games."
77,Devin Funchess CAR ,"It seems that everyone is forgetting how much Greg Olsen means to this offense and why Funchess got the volume he did last year. While he did a solid job, the Panthers felt the need to draft a wide receiver with their first-round pick, and one who‘ll play the underneath possession-style role, eliminating Funchess’ volume. He‘s going to be a lesser version of Kelvin Benjamin going forward."
Tier 6,,
78,Robby Anderson NYJ ,"This is a ranking that can move, as Anderson could potentially be suspended by the commissioner. He‘s had off -the-field issues multiple times, but the most recent arrest has some really bad details, particularly when he said things to a police officer about what he‘d do to his wife. He may escape legal trouble, but the NFL is sure to investigate. It could be an Ezekiel Elliott situation where we don‘t even know when the season begins, so you have to build that risk into his draft price. He belongs in the WR4 range because of it."
79,Marshawn Lynch OAK ,"The signing of Doug Martin makes little sense, but the fact that they held onto Lynch tells you what you need to know - he‘s going to play. He seemed to get better as the year went on in 2017, finishing as the No. 11 running back from Week 9 through Week 17. Apparently Jon Gruden wants to run the ball a lot, and even though his history says different, he has the personnel to do just that. Lynch is the new version of Frank Gore with more touchdown upside."
80,Jamison Crowder WAS ,"After the Redskins traded for Alex Smith, I knew I‘d be high on Crowder. My interest only grew fonder when the Redskins brought in Paul Richardson, who should help stretch the field and open things underneath for Crowder. Smith doesn‘t like throwing into tight windows, as evidenced by NFL‘s NextGenStats that show a league-low 12 percent of his throws went to a wide receiver with one or less yard of separation. While Richardson and Josh Doctson were mediocre at separating, Crowder averaged 3.2 yards of separation, which ranked eight among wide receivers in 2017."
81,Kyle Rudolph MIN ,"Take a look at the Vikings depth chart and you‘ll quickly discover that Rudolph is bound to be one of Kirk Cousins’ top targets. Cousins, meanwhile, is not only among the most efficient passers, but is also one of only five quarterbacks with at least 13,000 passing yards over the past three years. Perhaps most importantly, he loves throwing to tight end, as evidenced by the strong production of Niles Paul, Jordan Reed and Vernon Davis since Cousins took over. Rudolph is no slouch either. We have recently seen an 83 reception, 840 yard, 7 touchdown season, and he may pass all of those totals in 2018."
82,Kirk Cousins MIN ,"Many are assuming that just because the talent around Cousins got better, that he‘ll produce more than he did with the Redskins. I‘d hit the brakes on that assessment, as his efficiency was among the best in the game while there, and he was among the top-10 in pass attempts every season. Going to the Vikings (who threw the ball just 526 times in 2017) is going to change that, as their defense is top-three in the league, which doesn‘t allow shootouts. They also just lost their offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur, so it‘ll take some time for everyone to sync up. While Cousins should be a bit more consistent, I don‘t think he comes with the upside to warrant a top-eight quarterback selection."
83,Cooper Kupp LAR ,"Despite missing Week 17, Kupp finished as the No. 27 wide receiver in his rookie season, something that‘s not common in today‘s game. He did benefit from Robert Woods missing four games, and it now doesn‘t help that Brandin Cooks has been added to the mix. The part you can hang your hat on is that Kupp plays an entirely different role in the Rams offense than Cooks will, so it shouldn‘t affect his role too much. With Cooks, Woods, and Todd Gurley on the roster, it‘s going to be tough for Kupp to outperform last year‘s numbers without an injury."
84,Randall Cobb GB ,"I get it, Cobb‘s career has gone downhill the past few years, but that shouldn‘t force you to run from him completely. The last I checked, his quarterback is still Aaron Rodgers, which means 10 touchdowns is well within reach. Even with Jordy Nelson in town last year, Cobb saw 92 targets in 15 games, showing how much he still means to the offense. While there were rumors of him being cut due to his large salary cap number, they decided to hold on for another season, and you should, too."
85,Marlon Mack IND ,"It‘s a bit difficult to know how the Colts value Marlon Mack, as they didn‘t attack any of the big-name running backs in free agency, but did draft two running backs in the first five rounds. He apparently played through a shoulder injury that required surgery all of last season, so it‘s possible that we haven‘t seen the best of Mack. The Colts offense could be a juggernaut if Andrew Luck is, in fact, healthy once again. This is one backfield to pay attention to in the preseason."
86,Devante Parker MIA ,"There are a lot of fantasy players who are bailing on Parker at this point in his career, and while I get why they‘d want to do that, it‘s a mistake. He‘s a former first-round pick who is 6-foot-3 and 220 pounds, who has produced when he‘s been healthy. There‘ve been 25 games in which he‘s seen at least five targets, and in those games he‘s averaged 68.2 yards and 0.3 touchdowns, which is low-end WR2 numbers. He did that with Jarvis Landry on the team, who is now a Cleveland Browns receiver. It‘s rare to find a player this late in drafts who has 120-target potential, but Parker does. If he stays healthy, he‘s going to finish as a top-30 wide receiver with upside for more."
87,Matthew Stafford DET ,"It seems like Stafford is the same quarterback every year, as he‘s now finished in-between the QB5 and QB11 in six of the last seven seasons. Both him and Matt Ryan are the borderline QB1‘s that you don‘t LOVE drafting, but they‘re usually the safest picks on the board, though Stafford usually goes a bit earlier. While his overall numbers put him in the top-12, he‘s been outside the top-12 in each of the last four seasons when it comes to QB1 performance percentage, as he‘s typically around the 37.5 percent mark."
88,Marquise Goodwin SF ,"Goodwin is one of the tougher players to project this season, as the 49ers will be welcoming Pierre Garcon back to the lineup, they added Jerick McKinnon in free agency, and they traded up in the second-round to snag Dante Pettis. Still, Goodwin was the alpha-dog for Jimmy Garoppolo last year, totaling 51 targets, 34 receptions, 545 yards, and two touchdowns over the final seven games of the season. You have to wonder if that chemistry carries over into this season, or was it more of a “there‘s really no one else to throw to” scenario? There‘s risk with drafting him as a top-30 wide receiver, but if you get him around the WR35-40 range, you can afford to take that risk."
89,Duke Johnson CLE ,"There‘s a big debate going on between the experts and the public, but it feels like the public has adjusted better than the experts on this one. He had his most efficient season to date in 2017, yet Hue Jackson never gave him more than 10 carries. With all the weapons surrounding him in the passing-game now, it‘s extremely unlikely he even gets close to the 80.3 target average he has the last three years. And then they added both Carlos Hyde and Nick Chubb to handle the rushing attack, leaving little appeal to the third-down back. If you think you‘re being sneaky by landing him as your RB3, you‘re going to be disappointed."
90,Will Fuller HOU ,"Fuller caught a touchdown pass once every 7.1 targets in 2017, which led the NFL with ease, as the next closest with at least three touchdowns was Sammy Watkins, who caught one every 8.8 targets. After that, it was JuJu Smith-Schuster at 11.3 targets. Do you get my drift here? The players who were in his territory in 2016 were Donte Moncrief, Taylor Gabriel, and Kenny Stills. The addition of Keke Coutee in the draft definitely doesn‘t help get him more targets. He‘s going to be very boom-or-bust, though his boom weeks are going to be bigger than most in the WR4 conversation."
91,Kerryon Johnson DET ,"While I‘m typically pretty aggressive in my pursuit of high-round rookie running backs, Johnson has the toughest backfield to project. Not only did the Lions draft Johnson in the second-round, but they also snagged LeGarrette Blount in free agency. If there‘s one thing Blount does well, it‘s handle early-down work. If there‘s anything Theo Riddick does, it‘s handle third-down work. Do you see where this is going? Johnson is probably the best all-around running back on the roster, but they aren‘t benching Blount or Riddick, so he‘ll be left to battle for touches. Oh, and don‘t completely write-off Ameer Abdullah, who still has the possibility of being traded."
92,Isaiah Crowell NYJ ,"After playing behind one of the best offensive lines in football last year, Crowell will head to the Jets, whose running backs had a hard time finding many holes last year. He‘ll compete with Bilal Powell for touches and he no longer has Hue Jackson playing favoritism. Crowell is a plodder who struggles to create his own yardage, something that he‘ll really need to do while in New York. Let someone else remain hopeful, even with the injury to sophomore Elijah McGuire."
93,Trey Burton CHI ,"There is no denying that Burton was a highly sought after tight end free agent this off-season. The Bears ended up signing him to a big deal and he expects to step in right away as a playmaker. With that said, going from Wentz to Trubisky is a big drop off, and now, the Bears have plenty of weapons int he passing game so Burton may be overrated at this point. The upside is clearly there, but don‘t sleep on the risk."
94,Julian Edelman NE ,"Don‘t just automatically assume that just because Edelman is returning to the field, that he‘s going to be the same player. He‘s now 32 years old and coming off a torn ACL last preseason. It‘s not to say he can‘t return and produce, but he finished as the WR22 while playing all 16 games in his age-30 season. A lot of the targets have evaporated in the Patriots offense and you have to figure that Edelman will still get every opportunity to succeed, so you don‘t want to write him off completely. He‘s obviously someone who would benefit in a PPR format. He‘s now been suspended for the first four games, so it‘s going to be difficult to hang on to him because the first month is the most important time to acquire waiver wire players. He shouldn‘t be drafted as a top-50 wide receiver at this point."
95,Tarik Cohen CHI ,"Another team that didn‘t add a running back in the draft was the Bears, who will be riding the shoulders of Jordan Howard and Cohen. While they did add quite a bit of receiving talent to the roster, Cohen is a movable chess piece that Matt Nagy can have some fun with. Cohen was able to finish as the RB30 last year despite having the vanilla John Fox as his head coach."
96,Andrew Luck IND ,"Let‘s be real about this - nobody outside of Andrew Luck knows whether or not he can return to form. It‘s possible that it may take time for him to come around, and it‘s unlikely we get a large preview in the preseason. Because of that, he needs to be lowered on your draft board. When taking Luck, you‘re going to have to draft another quarterback to your squad, unless we‘ve seen him throw extensively. Prior to hurting his shoulder, Luck finished as a top-four quarterback in three of his last four seasons. All of the reports out of training camp have been good, but isn‘t that the report on everyone at this stage? We‘ll know more once we see Luck throw in the preseason."
97,Chris Thompson WAS ,"Coming back from a broken leg is never going to be easy to do, as you’ rather tear an ACL at this point in time. It‘s a shame, too, because Thompson just had a historic season. While most talk about Alvin Kamara‘s ridiculous efficiency, they looked over how impressive Thompson was while averaging 7.81 yards per touch, which was more than Kamara who averaged 7.73 yards per touch. It wasn‘t just yardage, either, as there‘ve been 265 running backs over the last five years who‘ve totaled at least 100 touches, and Thompson‘s 1.47 PPR fantasy points per touch ranked second to only Kamara in that span."
98,Sterling Shepard NYG ,"Over the first two years of his career, Shepard has shown the ability to step-up and be the focal point of a passing attack, though he doesn‘t need to be with Odell Beckham Jr. on the field. To know that he has that ability is a bonus, though, as Beckham Jr. has dealt with injuries throughout his career. Pat Shurmur did wonders for Adam Thielen‘s career while working out of the slot, which is where Shepard has played over 80 percent of his snaps the last two years. He‘s going to give you WR4 production regardless, but has upside for more."
99,Jordy Nelson OAK ,"Let‘s be clear - when you go from Aaron Rodgers to Derek Carr, there‘s going to be a massive efficiency decline. One positive from the move to the Raiders is that it appears they‘ll be using him in the slot, similarly to the way that the Cardinals use Larry Fitzgerald. Nelson isn‘t as physically imposing as Fitzgerald, and he‘s also got to compete with Amari Cooper and Martavis Bryant for targets. While Nelson will be usable as a safe WR4 play most weeks, he doesn‘t offer you much upside."
100,Jordan Reed WAS ,"You may be ready to give up on Jordan Reed, but his profile has hardly changed from where it was last season, yet somehow, he is being drafted nearly 60 spots lower. Reed was an obvious overdraft last season in the 40s, but he still has elite efficiency to his name and if he can manage to play 12+ games, we‘ve got a surefire top 5 fantasy tight end on our hands."
101,Ben Roethlisberger PIT ,"Did you know that Roethlisberger has been a top-8 fantasy quarterback just twice during his 14-year career? Missed games play into that a lot, but he‘s never been one of the “elites” in fantasy football. With that being said, he‘s finished top-10 in two of the last four seasons and may now have the best wide receiver group he‘s ever had in Antonio Brown, JuJu Smith-Schuster, and James Washington. The Steelers defense is in somewhat of a rebuild mode, so it shouldn‘t be shocking to see him in more shootouts like the one against the Jaguars in the playoffs. He‘s not going to be an every-week starter, but he‘s going to win you some weeks."
102,C.J. Anderson CAR ,"Most thought it was a terrible landing spot for Anderson in Carolina, but it was likely the best-case scenario. Most don‘t realize that Jonathan Stewart totaled 198 carries last year, which ranked inside the top-20 at the position. Anderson has always been one of the most efficient runners on first- and second-down while playing behind a mediocre offensive line. If he reaches the same amount of carries that Stewart did, he‘s going to finish as a top-24 running back. The best part is that you don‘t have to spend even a top-30 running back pick on him."
103,Jamaal Williams GB ,"Part of the reason analysts are predicting that Aaron Jones will win the job is because of Williams’ inability to create big plays. He had just one run of more than 15 yards (25 yards) on 153 carries, the worst big-play rate in the NFL. He did show the ability to carry the ball 20-plus times per game and the offensive line was a bit dinged up, so don‘t simply dismiss him, either. Taking him outside the top-30 running backs isn‘t bad, as there‘s legitimate top-10 upside with any starting running back in the Packers offense. Just know that he‘s got very-high bust potential as well. It‘s a bonus that Jones is suspended for the first two games of the season, but when you see that the Packers play the Bears and Vikings over the first two weeks, it‘s not the greatest start to the schedule and could very well make him look bad."
104,Carlos Hyde CLE ,"He‘s someone I was targeting in best-ball leagues as a low-end RB2 prior to the NFL Draft, as I do believe the Browns are going to be run-heavy in 2018. While that‘s still going to be the case, them drafting Nick Chubb in the second-round was the worst-case scenario for Hyde (outside of them taking Saquon Barkley). Chubb is essentially a younger version of Hyde, but faster. I still believe Hyde gets 10-12 touches per game, but it‘s not enough to crack the top-30 running backs."
105,Nelson Agholor PHI ,"For someone who ranked 50th in targets per game among wide receivers last year, Agholor is getting a lot of love in early drafts. Knowing that, tied in with the fact that Carson Wentz will regress in the touchdown department, and you have yourself a recipe for disaster when taking him as a top-35 wide receiver (as he‘s currently being drafted)."
106,Philip Rivers LAC ,"Facts are facts and Rivers has now finished as a top-12 quarterback in eight of the last 10 seasons. He‘s got one of the better offensive lines in football and his weapons have never been better than they are right now. There‘s not enough love for the boring low-end QB1, though his stock took a slight hit when Hunter Henry went down with a torn ACL. Here‘s to hoping Mike Williams can be a solid red-zone threat."
107,Kelvin Benjamin BUF ,"Let me be clear - I‘m not a fan of Benjamin the player, but I am a fan of the targets he‘ll see with no other viable wide receiver in Buffalo. It was the reason he saw 115-plus targets in Carolina, and the quarterback situation wasn‘t much better (from an accuracy standpoint), but he was able to finish as a top-24 receiver multiple times. Targets first, talent second in fantasy football. As long as Benjamin shows he‘s healthy when drafts start taking place, he‘s worthy of a top-40 wide receiver pick."
108,Jimmy Garoppolo SF ,"There‘s a lot of hype surrounding Garoppolo, who finished the season with a bang. His 8.8 yards per attempt ranks as third-best of any quarterback who‘s thrown the ball at least 100 times in the last five years. With that being said, he did finish with just 7 touchdowns and 5 interceptions in five starts, so it wasn‘t all coming together just yet. He lacks a true No. 1 receiver, which may hurt his overall touchdown numbers, and he doesn‘t offer any rushing upside, as he‘s rushed for just 17 yards in his seven NFL starts. There‘s definitely a chance that he gets into QB1 territory, but you shouldn‘t pay for that just yet."
109,Kenny Stills MIA ,"Without looking, where do you think Stills would rank among wide receivers in yards and touchdowns over the last two years? I bet you didn‘t think he was 32nd in yards and 9th in touchdowns. Even though I believe Devante Parker has a career-year, there‘s plenty of targets to go around, as the Dolphins were one of just three teams who had three receivers with more than 80 targets, and they were the only team with three wide receivers who had 96 or more targets. With Jarvis Landry out, Stills’ target ceiling is likely around 115."
Tier 7,,
110,George Kittle SF ,"When you watch Kittle play, it is easy to imagine him morphing into a star tight end with Jimmy G. The matter of the fact is, however, that he was merely mediocre with Jimmy under center. In fact, Garrett Celek outscored Kittle in that time despite full health for Kittle. That isn‘t to say things can‘t change over the off-season, but just know that drafting Kittle as a TE1 is no sure thing."
111,Jack Doyle IND ,"This is one of the most difficult players to forecast. Not only does Andrew Luck‘s shoulder linger over Doyle‘s production, but the Colts made a move for Eric Ebron who is one of just 14 tight ends all-time to receive for over 2,000 yards before his 25th birthday. There is a chance that Doyle finishes as a top-five tight end and also a decent chance he is entirely irrelevant. I don‘t mind buying a lottery ticket, just be aware that it is what we are getting out of Doyle."
112,Matt Ryan ATL ,"The addition of Calvin Ridley bumped Ryan‘s stock up just a bit, enough to move him ahead of guys like Jared Goff and Jimmy Garoppolo. Ryan isn‘t going to be the top fantasy quarterback that he was in 2016, but he‘s someone you should be happy to roster if you‘re waiting until the late rounds to draft your quarterback."
113,Rishard Matthews TEN ,"Despite Marcus Mariota getting hurt in 2016 and struggling through much of 2017, Matthews remained consistent in his production, hauling in 61 percent of his passes for 14.5 and 15.0 yards per reception in each year. The area his production dipped, though, was targets and touchdowns. With Corey Davis slated for a bigger role in 2018, you should expect that decline to continue, though Matthews won‘t go away, as he‘s been extremely efficient with his targets. He‘s comparable to the Titans version of DeSean Jackson."
114,Marqise Lee JAC ,"Most don‘t seem to know that despite missing two games in 2017 that Lee ranks 27th in targets among wide receivers over the last two years. Keep in mind that Allen Robinson was healthy and played the entire 2016 season, so this is noteworthy. The Jaguars let Robinson walk, but retained Lee on a four-year, $34 million contract, which wasn‘t far off what Robinson got with the Bears. I he stays healthy, he‘s locked into 100-plus targets, which is why he should be considered a borderline WR3 with some upside if Blake Bortles continues to improve."
115,Allen Hurns DAL ,"As of right now, Hurns is the No. 1 receiver for the Cowboys, though you shouldn‘t expect him to carry that role for very long with Michael Gallup in the picture. Still, there‘s value for a wide receiver who will see anywhere from 5-8 targets from Dak Prescott. Hurns did produce quite a few fantasy relevant weeks with Blake Bortles, so it‘s possible he turns out to be better than most expect."
116,Jared Goff LAR ,"Last season, Goff managed to finish the year as a QB1, but then again, so did Bortles so that really shouldn‘t mean too much. In fact, his touchdown rate was inflated, the Rams lost Sammy Watkins and he threw only 477 passes. Goff shouldn‘t be considered much more than a game manager."
117,Patrick Mahomes KC ,"Despite starting just one NFL game in Week 17, there are some who are willing to invest a top-12 quarterback pick on Mahomes. Don‘t count me as one of them, though. Sure, he‘s got a cannon for an arm, but so did Jay Cutler. He‘s got some mobility, but when you have Kareem Hunt, plays aren‘t going to be designed for him to rush for 50 yards per game. Bottom line, there‘s massive potential here, but he‘s essentially a rookie. At the quarterback position, there‘s no reason you need to take unnecessary risks when there are so many safe options. If Mahomes falls out of the top-15, that‘s when you should start considering him."
118,Marcus Mariota TEN ,"After what was a stellar start to his NFL career where he threw 45 touchdowns to just 19 interceptions, Mariota took a giant step back in 2017, despite being given better options to throw to. The good news is that he didn‘t stop running the ball, as he ran for five touchdowns, easily a career-high. He also just inherited Matt LaFleur as his offensive coordinator, someone who has been tutored by Sean McVay. With the weaponry that he has, there‘s no reason to think that Mariota can‘t finish as a top-12 quarterback, but his performance in 2017 left a bad taste in your mouth. When drafting him around the QB18 range, you‘re taking very little risk, but major upside if he returns to his pre-2017 form."
119,Ty Montgomery GB ,"After being given the starting job to start 2017, Montgomery lost that role when he injured his ribs early in the season. From that point, both Jamaal Williams and Aaron Jones shined in their roles, making it easier for the Packers to give Montgomery less work as the year went on. It seems he may play more of a hybrid RB/WR role this year, and that may be the ideal case for him. He may end up as a Theo Riddick-type player, though Aaron Rodgers has never checked down that much."
120,David Njoku CLE ,"Most have Njoku as a top fifteen fantasy tight end or even in their top 10 but the reality here is that Njoku is at the very least, fourth fiddle in the receiving game behind Jarvis Landry, Josh Gordon and Duke Johnson. The Browns have plenty of depth behind that trio too plus their QB, Tyrod Taylor, is unlikely to throw even 500 passes."
121,Nick Chubb CLE ,"It‘s very possible that Chubb moves up my board as the offseason goes on, but it‘s unrealistic to think that he walks in and takes the starting job from Carlos Hyde, the veteran they hand-selected early in free agency. While Chubb is their running back of the future, it‘s hard to love him with Hyde and Duke Johnson in town, as they have early-down work covered, as well as third-down work, though Chubb doesn‘t contribute much in the passing-game. He‘s simply a high-upside stash right now who is likely to see 5-10 carries per game early in the season."
122,Aaron Jones GB ,"As of right now, Jones might be the rare case of getting the starting running back in a top-six scoring offense outside of the top-100. Most are torn on which running back to take out of Green Bay, but there‘ve been rumors that Jones earned the job last year. Whatever the case, he‘s going to score some touchdowns, even if he‘s involved in a timeshare. I‘d rather take the upside of Jones than someone who may have more guaranteed touches, like Bilal Powell. If you do draft him, don‘t forget that he‘s suspended for the first two weeks of the season."
123,Giovani Bernard CIN ,"It‘s clear that the Bengals didn‘t ever view Bernard as a three-down back, as they‘ve now drafted three running backs with high equity. Still, he‘s had a role with a team throughout the whole time, so it‘s unrealistic to think that ends now. He‘s never finished outside the top 45 running backs during his five-year career, and that‘s despite scoring just two rushing touchdowns in each of the last three seasons. He‘s a safe-floor, though low-upside option."
124,Alex Smith WAS ,"Most people say that 2017 was an outlier year for Smith, and while it‘s hard to disagree that it was better than the rest, he‘s been doing this for a while now. Since 2011, Smith has thrown 132 touchdowns compared to just 43 interceptions. In that period, there are just two quarterbacks who have a better TD:INT ratio than him: Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady. You don‘t do that over a seven-year period if you‘re a mediocre quarterback. With Jay Gruden‘s history with Kirk Cousins, it‘s very possible that we‘re underestimating Smith‘s fantasy potential. If you‘re the type to grab two quarterbacks in a draft, Smith would make an excellent No. 2."
125,Josh Doctson WAS ,"We didn‘t get the best numbers from Doctson, so it makes sense why many will be avoiding him, but do consider that he is the Redskins’ top receiver, and that is exactly why defenses focused on locking him down with their shadow corners. He had the single toughest set of matchups last season and as that lets up, we should see plenty of production."
126,Kenny Golladay DET ,"It seems that the Lions are trying to make Golladay a thing in 2018, though I‘m not seeing it without taking away targets from Golden Tate and Marvin Jones. Outside of those two, the leading receiver on the Lions last year was T.J. Jones with 49 targets. With Matt Patricia coming to town, you have to figure they lean more on the run, especially when you factor in the additions of both LeGarrette Blount and Kerryon Johnson. Without injury, Golladay is going to be a spot-starter, at best."
127,Dak Prescott DAL ,"If you would‘ve asked me a month ago, I would‘ve told you that Prescott was being undervalued. A lot has changed since then, as the Cowboys released Dez Bryant, didn‘t draft a wide receiver in the first-round, and then had Jason Witten retire mid-draft. The Cowboys are going to rely on Ezekiel Elliott more than ever."
128,Devontae Booker DEN ,"I love Royce Freeman‘s game, which is why I don‘t view Booker as a threat to him. With that being said, NFL teams sometimes do some weird things and make rookies “earn their stripes."" Booker is someone who played behind C.J. Anderson the last few years, and the Broncos cut Anderson this offseason. Then they drafted Freeman in the third-round. What does that tell you about Booker? He‘s just a handcuff and not one that you should go out of your way to draft, as we‘ve seen him in a workhorse role before back in 2016. It wasn‘t pretty."
129,Cameron Meredith NO ,"It was a knee injury that looked like it could be a career-ender, but Meredith latched on with the Saints this offseason and will now be catching passes from Drew Brees. Shortly after snagging him, the Saints cut ties with Willie Snead, opening up the slot role that Meredith played so well while with the Bears. Meredith‘s sample size is relatively small, but when you rack up 888 yards and four touchdowns from Brian Hoyer and Matt Barkley, there‘s plenty of optimism. The issue is that Michael Thomas, Alvin Kamara, Ted Ginn, and maybe even Ben Watson are ahead of him in the pecking order. He‘s likely to have some big weeks, but I wouldn‘t expect a weekly contributor."
130,O.J. Howard TB ,"Howard was unbelievably efficient last season with 432 yards and 6 TDs in just 39 targets. Granted, that touchdown rate is nearly impossible to repeat, but it goes without saying that his target total will at least double if the Bucs know what is good for them. In standard leagues, he was only 30 fantasy points behind Evan Engram despite 76 fewer targets."
131,DeSean Jackson TB ,"When you watch as much football as I do, you see some things that some people may have missed. When it comes to Jackson, he and Jameis Winston were just a touch off on connecting for multiple 40-plus yard touchdowns, which would have dramatically changed how fantasy players valued him this offseason. There were four passes that I can recall right now that were within a yard or two of his hands that might turn into long touchdowns this year. Even in what was a “down year” for him, he produced WR3 numbers 50 percent of the time, which ranked 33rd among wide receivers."
132,D.J. Moore CAR ,"It was shocking to see the Panthers snag Moore with Calvin Ridley still on the board, but they obviously had him higher on their board. He‘s going to have to compete with Devin Funchess, Greg Olsen, and Christian McCaffrey for targets, which is less than ideal considering that Cam Newton isn‘t what we‘d call an accurate quarterback. Moore might turn out to be the most productive wide receiver in Carolina, but that might not be saying much. Be prepared for a roller coaster in fantasy."
133,Theo Riddick DET ,"The Lions backfield is loaded with a bunch of decent backs who are all about on the same level. It will be tough for most of them to find touches except for Riddick who has his job locked in. Expect much of the same, making him a solid depth piece to fill in during bye weeks and injuries."
134,Tyler Eifert CIN ,"Sure, there is a chance we see another 140 point fantasy season from Eifert, but even that 2015 output appeared to be a fluke. He had an absurd touchdown rate and just 615 receiving yards. More likely, we will see the version who has missed significant time in three of the past four seasons. Rememeber, nobody wanted him in free agency so he crawled back to the Bengals. That should tell you just about everything you need to know."
135,James White NE ,"White has finished as a top-50 running back in each of the last three seasons, but never better than the RB35 in standard leagues. He‘s someone who will hurt you more than often because he simply doesn‘t get enough weekly touches to be consistent, meaning he‘ll need to score a touchdown to not completely bust. With Sony Michel and Rex Burkhead on the field, it‘s not likely that White earns any more work in 2018. He‘s just a spot-starter and one who‘ll be incredibly difficult to predict."
136,Bilal Powell NYJ ,"It‘s not an ideal situation in New York, but if you really think they‘ll lean on Isaiah Crowell more than they did Matt Forte, you‘re going about this the wrong way. Powell should at least have the same role he had last year, if not more. He finished as the RB26, less than double his current cost. He‘s not someone who will win you your fantasy league, but he can most definitely play a role."
137,Tyler Lockett SEA ,"Some are scared of Brandon Marshall signing, but you shouldn‘t be one of them, as I don‘t even think he‘s a lock to make the roster. Lockett isn‘t someone I‘d chase in drafts, but he plays with Russell Wilson, has flashed before, and the touchdowns have to go somewhere. His price doesn‘t reflect any of that."
138,Charles Clay BUF ,"While Clay may not have had the best numbers last season, but prior to his injury, the Bills were peppering him with targets. Once he returned, Clay wasn‘t quite himself, but over the final three weeks of the season, he saw another 27 targets which has to encourage fantasy owners. Add in the fact that the Bills still have limited receiving weapons and Clay doesn‘t make a bad tight end in deep leagues or best ball contests."
Tier 8,,
139,Chris Carson SEA ,"Although the Seahawks just spent serious draft capital on a running back, it is growing more difficult to ignore the reports about Chris Carson excelling this off-season. Pete Carroll is not afraid to give the better man the job and accept a sunken cost."
140,Jacksonville Jaguars ,"It‘s not often that I‘d support the idea of drafting a defense before the final round, but the Jaguars are a slightly different animal. They are one of the most dominant defenses we‘ve seen in their lifetime, they haven‘t lost any of their important pieces, and they‘re extremely young."
141,Mohamed Sanu ATL ,"While I‘ve got Calvin Ridley higher in my rankings, Sanu is the safer draft pick. He‘s a proven veteran who knows the offense, and posted WR3 numbers in 67 percent of his games last year, which ranked 13th among wide receivers. He doesn‘t have much upside, but if you‘re looking for a safe, high-floor type producer, Sanu is your guy."
142,Eric Ebron IND ,"It may be tempting, but don‘t be so quick to give up on Ebron. Since 2000, only Gronk, Tony Gonzalez, Jason Witten and Jeremy Shockey have as many receiving yards as Ebron before their 25th birthdays. Ebron mightl have to overtake Doyle before having much relevance, but there is a shot it happens or that they use him as a move tight end with Doyle on the line in two tight end sets. That means there is a shot Ebron morphs into a top-five fantasy tight end with Andrew Luck throwing him the ball."
143,Cameron Brate TB ,"If the Bucs hadn‘t just signed Brate to a big-time contract, I‘d be ready to fade Brate, considering how excellent O.J. Howard was once he took over. The Bucs did sign Brate, however, and Jameis has made it clear that he loves Brate. When Jameis was the starting QB, Brate was a top four fantasy tight end last season. In fact, in the six games Brate started, the Harvard grad was a top 12 tight end even more often than Gronk."
144,Corey Clement PHI ,"It seemed that Clement started to pick up steam in his pursuit for more snaps as the year went on, but he never topped 28 snaps. Keep in mind that‘s with Darren Sproles missing essentially the entire season, and he‘s been brought back in 2018. Between Sproles, Jay Ajayi, and Clement, this is going to be a wildly inconsistent backfield for fantasy purposes. He‘s nothing more than a bench-stash who has value should something happen to Ajayi or Sproles."
145,Minnesota Vikings ,
146,Blake Bortles JAC ,"While many spend a fortune to acquire Deshaun Watson, many are overlooking the fact that Bortles had “almost” as good of a stretch that Watson did. From Week 13-16 (four games), Bortles threw for 321.3 yards and 2.3 touchdowns per game. During Watson‘s five-game stretch, he averaged 294.4 yards and 3.6 touchdowns per game. The reason people think Watson could be the real-deal is because that‘s really one of the only sample size we have on him, whereas most “know what they are getting” with Bortles. Is that fair, though, considering he was a top-10 quarterback twice? Bottom line is that Bortles has been really streaky and has shown more bad than good, but the hate on him has gone a bit too far this offseason. With him rushing for at least 310 yards in every season, it‘s possible that we see him finish inside the top-15 this year, though you don‘t want to pay for those up-and-downs in his performances."
147,Mitch Trubisky CHI ,"If I‘m being honest, I tempered expectations when doing Trubisky‘s projections, which made me think I‘d be lower than the consensus. It‘s clear that not enough people have taken notice to the effect that a young offensive-minded head coach can do for a quarterback. Trubisky has been surrounded by a ton of weapons and has extremely underrated mobility, something that fantasy footballers should covet."
148,Derek Carr OAK ,"This time last year, Carr was the fourth quarterback off the board. He struggled through injuries last season and finished as the QB21. In 2016, however, he was a top 10 QB so you‘d have to think it will end up somewhere in between, making him merely a streamer for the time being."
149,Dez Bryant FA ,"He doesn‘t have a team right now, but it doesn‘t mean that you should ignore him. Wherever Bryant lands, it‘ll be with a team who knows the risk as well as the reward, and they wouldn‘t bring him in to not be a vital part of their offense. Stay tuned, as his ranking will move depending on the team he lands with."
150,Anthony Miller CHI ,"Many are clamoring for Miller to get big targets as a rookie in Chicago, but there are a few problems with that notion. First, Trubisky has some major question marks. Additionally, Allen Robinson, Trey Burton, Taylor Gabriel, Tarik Cohen and Kevin White are all going to be seeing targets too. Miller may have value, but his upside is limited."
151,Jared Cook OAK ,"It is hard not to like the weapons Cook is competing with from Amari Cooper and Jordy Nelson to Martavis Bryant, but Cook was seventh in receiving yards last season so he is definitely still a fantasy asset. Granted, Derek Carr has taken a big step back so there will only be so many touchdowns to go around. You‘d expect Cook to improve on the two he posted last year, though, and if he had even three, we would have been looking at a top 12 fantasy tight end."
152,Calvin Ridley ATL ,"I banged the drum for Ridley all offseason, saying he was the most pro-ready receiver in the draft. When he was taken by the Falcons, it was tough to love the landing spot, as Julio Jones demands a lot of targets. With that, Ridley will see a lot of No. 2 cornerbacks in man coverage, meaning he‘s going to have some big weeks. Think about Taylor Gabriel‘s effect he had on the Falcons offense in his first year there and that‘s likely what you‘ll get out of Ridley in 2018. He‘s just a WR4/5, but he‘s going to have some massive weeks."
153,Mike Williams LAC ,"Once word came out about Hunter Henry tearing his ACL, most wanted to look at which tight end would take his place. Truth be told, Williams is the one who‘s likely to see the biggest increase in targets because of Henry‘s injury. He was drafted inside the top-10 to become a red zone presence for Philip Rivers, though his back injury limited his playing time in 2017. Having an injury-free offseason would be big for him to develop some chemistry with Rivers and work his way into the offense. It seems like it‘ll be him, Keenan Allen, and Tyrell Williams in 3WR sets, meaning he should see a minimum of 50 targets this season. He‘s someone you can draft and you‘ll likely know what you have within the first week or two."
154,Philadelphia Eagles ,
155,Paul Richardson WAS ,"The landing spot was an odd one for Richardson, as he might be the fifth option on the depth chart behind Jamison Crowder, Jordan Reed, Chris Thompson, and maybe even Josh Doctson. They apparently brought him in to be the downfield threat in the offense, but Richardson wasn‘t much of a separator last year with the Seahawks, but did rack up nine plays of more than 20 yards. Alex Smith was the best deep passer in the NFL last year, though it probably helps to have Tyreek Hill scooting down the field. Richardson is likely to be a very boom-or-bust fantasy option, making him just a high-upside bye week filler."
156,D'Onta Foreman HOU ,"It was a shame to see Foreman go down with a devastating Achilles injury last year, as he was starting to cut into Lamar Miller‘s workload. In fact, there were rumors that the Texans may have cut Miller if Foreman would be guaranteed healthy by Week 1. Unfortunately, we don‘t know if he will be, and there are rumors that he could start the year on the PUP list, which would put him out the first six weeks. He‘s someone to keep an eye on throughout the offseason, as his fantasy stock depends on how healthy he is. His final 44 carries netted him 213 yards (4.84 YPC) and two touchdowns."
157,Nyheim Hines IND ,"Say hello to the next Darren Sproles. He doesn‘t have the upside of a D‘Onta Foreman who could be a workhorse running back in the right scenario, but Hines is a good bet to contribute in the passing game each and every week so if you are in a deeper league, don‘t hesitate to add him."
158,Eli Manning NYG ,"When you‘ve got analysts everywhere saying that Odell Beckham is a top-three wide receiver, Evan Engram is a top-five tight end, and Saquon Barkley is a top-six running back, why is Manning so low on lists? It‘s a fact that they cannot all produce like that if Manning is outside the top-24 quarterbacks. Prior to the 2017 season, Manning had averaged 4,290 yards and 30.3 touchdowns in the previous three seasons. Those numbers would have made him a top-10 quarterback in 2017. With Pat Shurmur coming to town, you should expect Manning to take a step forward and be better than most expect. He‘s someone who is ideal for 2QB leagues, but will be able to be streamed in 1QB leagues."
159,Los Angeles Rams ,
160,Latavius Murray MIN ,"Dalvin Cook was an absolute bell-cow for the Vikings before his injury, but a lot of that may have been because Murray was injured. There is a possibility that Murray has a role in a split backfield sort of situation and gets some goal-line carries. Plus, just imagine how Murray would perform if Cook was hurt and McKinnon now out of his way."
161,Matt Breida SF ,"He‘s potentially one of the more undervalued backup running backs, but that may have something to do with Joe Williams returning from injury. Truth be told, Breida beat out Williams last year in training camp. Knowing how much Jerick McKinnon has struggled on first- and second-down over the course of his career, it‘s possible that Breida has value as more than just a handcuff in Kyle Shanahan‘s two-back offense."
162,Austin Seferian-JenkinsJAC ,Early reports indicate that ASJ has quickly become one of Blake Bortles’ favorite targets. This should come as no surprise considering run-blocking 33-year-old Marcedes Lewis has five touchdowns for the Jags last season. ASJ is a significantly better weapon and has a chance to finally realize his potential this season in an offense that has lackluster receiving and tight-end friendly quarterback.
163,Tyrell Williams LAC ,"Mike Williams is expected to start with Keenan Allen, but now that Hunter Henry is gone and the Chargers didn‘t replace him, we might end up seeing Williams get enough targets to monitor for fantasy purposes. There will be some weeks where he posts big numbers, so queue him up in best ball formats."
164,Los Angeles Chargers ,
165,Ted Ginn NO ,"Another year with Drew Brees, yet his cost is down? Well, to be fair, Ginn is now 33 years old and the Saints have added a lot of new pieces around him. Cameron Meredith was a pretty solid signing, as was drafting Tre‘Quan Smith, who is known as a downfield receiver. We also cannot forget the addition of Ben Watson, who is sure to see more targets than Coby Fleener did the last two seasons. There were just five games where Ginn saw more than five targets last year, meaning his fantasy production is going to be sporadic. He also caught a ridiculous 76 percent of passes, which was far more than his previous career-high of 58 percent, so you‘re looking at some regression. He‘s a guy you plug in for bye weeks and hope you get one of his better performances."
166,Case Keenum DEN ,"John Elway did not go get a quarterback in the draft because he appears to be confident in what Keenum offers. Now, he isn‘t start worthy every week, but with Thomas and Sanders in the receiver core, there will be a couple starts this season that he provides useful performances."
167,Houston Texans ,
168,Denver Broncos ,
169,Dede Westbrook JAC ,"There are some in the industry who adore Westbrook, but most see him as the clear-cut fourth wide receiver in a weak passing offense. Obviously if the second is correct, there is no value unless someone gets injured. He isn‘t the worst possible late-round pick, however, as there is some upside."
170,LeGarrette Blount DET ,"Potentially the worst landing spot for someone with his skill-set, as players who don‘t participate in the passing-game don‘t stay on the field under Jim Bob Cooter. It‘s possible that new head coach Matt Patricia wanted Blount from his days in New England, but when they drafted Kerryon Johnson in the second-round, it pretty much buried the hope for Blount. He may score from time-to-time, but you‘re better off letting someone else draft him."
171,Doug Martin OAK ,"It seems like his ADP may move up sooner than I‘d hoped, but Martin is one of my favorite late-round sleepers. Word has come out that he looks phenomenal at OTAs. Battling a 32-year-old Marshawn Lynch who has a history of back problems? Playing behind a top-five offensive line? Sign me up. It‘s rare to find a running back being draft so late who has multiple 1,400-yard rushing seasons on his resume."
172,Jameis Winston TB ,"Winston is suspended for three weeks so he is undraftable outside of two-qb leagues. When he returns, however, we are looking at a top-10 quarterback. He was superb last season when healthy and still getting better."
173,Martavis Bryant OAK ,"So, Bryant went from competing with Antonio Brown and JuJu Smith-Schuster for targets, to now competing with Amari Cooper and Jordy Nelson for targets. I don‘t think this will end well, considering the quality of the targets will also go down. The positive is that Derek Carr has plenty of arm strength to get the ball downfield to Bryant, but Cooper and Nelson should dominate the work underneath, making him a very boom-or-bust fantasy option. He‘s going to be more appealing in the weeks that Amari Cooper is projected to be shadowed by a true No. 1 cornerback."
174,Ricky Seals-Jones ARI ,"Seals-Jones is an elite athlete who excelled in spurts last season, but hardly saw the field enough to make a difference. If that should change this pre-season, he would be an immediate top sleeper candidate all across the industry since Arizona lost so many targets and upgraded to Sam Bradford at quarterback."
175,Andy Dalton CIN ,"Most find it fun to dog Dalton after his lackluster 2017 campaign, but did you know that he‘s still yet to finish outside the top-18 fantasy quarterbacks? It‘s because he‘s typically healthy, has a solid cast of wide receivers, and has no threat of getting benched. It was his yardage that took the biggest hit in 2017, because his touchdown (25) to interception (12) ratio was actually solid. The Bengals need to inject some youth into the offense, so expect to see Joe Mixon and John Ross a lot more involved in year-two, which could revive Dalton‘s fantasy status. He‘s a solid No. 2 quarterback in 2QB leagues."
176,Peyton Barber TB ,"Some are still expecting Barber to start for the Bucs, eh? When you draft a running back at the top of the second-round, call me skeptical. Whether or not you like it, draft stock matters. Barber is a formerly undrafted free agent who the Bucs let sit on the bench while Doug Martin and Charles Sims combined for 1,071 yards on 354 carries over the last two years. That amounts to just 3.03 yards per carry. While Barber played better, they obviously felt the need to invest in Ronald Jones. He‘s just the handcuff, guys."
177,Frank Gore MIA ,"You want to say that Gore wouldn‘t have gone to the Dolphins to just sit on the bench in his final year, but it‘s hard seeing him receive many touches with youngsters Kenyan Drake and Kalen Ballage on the roster. But still, why would the Dolphins sign him if they weren‘t planning on at least using him in a 8-10 touch per game role? It‘s an odd situation for sure, but knowing that Gore has averaged just 3.8 yards per carry over the last three years makes your life easier. His best days are behind him and he‘s playing behind what will be one of the worst offensive lines in his career. You‘re better off looking for someone who presents actual upside late in drafts."
178,Chris Godwin TB ,"Last season, Godwin was extremely efficient with his targets. Now that he is starting, those targets should increase and we could see a breakout. He still has Mike Evans, DeSean Jackson and two strong tight ends to share work with, however, so that breakout comes with a capped ceiling."
179,Michael Gallup DAL ,"I just do not believe that Allen Hurns, Deonte Thompson, and Cole Beasley are going to be the Cowboys starting wide receivers for long. Gallup is the one wide receiver on that team with the ability to potentially be a top-30 wide receiver in this league and it‘s not going to happen sitting on the bench behind the B-squad. Even if he doesn‘t start Week 1, it‘s only a matter of time before they start giving him reps, and he‘ll quickly become Dak Prescott‘s go-to receiver, giving you multiple usable fantasy weeks in the process."
180,Benjamin Watson NO ,"Watson is old as dirt, but he was remarkably efficient last year even with Joe Flacco, posting a huge 77.2% catch rate for 522 yards and 4 touchdowns on just 79 targets. Now that he is returning to New Orleans, where Brees loves to pass to tight ends, we may just see Watson return to the 110 targets and #8 tight end finish that Watson posted in the same offense during the 2015 season."
181,Stephen Gostkowski NE ,
182,Baltimore Ravens ,
Tier 9,,
183,Justin Tucker BAL ,
184,Greg Zuerlein LAR ,
185,Austin Hooper ATL ,"We know Hooper has plenty of upside, but with the addition of Calvin Ridley, it seems unlikely that his target share will improve much more, if at all. Unless they start throwing Hooper the ball much more often than we saw last season, he has essentially zero fantasy value."
186,Chris Ivory BUF ,"Chris Ivory would be expected to step into a much larger role should LeSean McCoy end up suspended or cut as a result of the allegations. He isn‘t the most talented player, nor is he in a strong offense, but there is no subsitute for touches."
187,Donte Moncrief JAC ,"Apparently, the Jags are going to start Moncrief over Dede Westbrook and DJ Chark. If that is the case then he has some value, but moving from Andrew Luck to Blake Bortles and an offense who wants to run as often as possible limits his upside."
188,Kenneth Dixon BAL ,"Don‘t forget about the guy that the Ravens were extremely high on coming into last year before he suffered a season-ending injury. I‘m not projecting him to take the starting job back immediately, but it wouldn‘t surprise me if he worked his way back into fantasy relevance at some point. The one-year contract for Alex Collins doesn‘t scream confidence."
189,Vance McDonald PIT ,"It is no guarantee that the Steelers will give McDonald the starting job, but should he take it over from Jesse James, we would be looking at a breakout candidate with top 10 tight end upside. McDonald is a capable athlete who could excel in the red zone of Big Ben‘s offense."
190,Tyrod Taylor CLE ,"Tyrod has never had weapons like this, yet has always managed to be a sufficient fantasy asset. Feel free to use him until his time as the starter runs out, especially in two-qb leagues. He will go undrafted in most leagues, but makes for a great streamer at times."
191,Ryan Tannehill MIA ,"Tannehill may have lost Jarvis Landry, but the Dolphins picked up some extra weapons too. If he is healthy, he is a safe bet for 4,000 yards. You can‘t start him every week even in two-QB leagues, but there will be more than a handful of matchups where you might want to consider him."
192,Mike Gesicki MIA ,"While you may not be excited about the Dolphins’ passing game, it is worth noting that Tannehill posted back to back 4,000 yard seasons before his injury and threw the ball at least 580 times three straight years. Their receiving threats are limited so don‘t be surprised if the freak athlete, Gesicki makes the most of his starting role."
193,Austin Ekeler LAC ,"It seemed that while the Chargers used Ekeler in an extended role while Melvin Gordon was dinged up last year, they wanted to upgrade their depth chart. While some will see that they didn‘t draft a running back until the seventh-round and think Ekeler is fine, you have to know that Justin Jackson (that pick) would‘ve gone earlier if he didn‘t have so much mileage on his body. He was best-suited for a backup role, while Ekeler is likely the new Branden Oliver."
194,Quincy Enunwa NYJ ,"Josh McCown was actually really good last season and seeing that he is starting again in 2018 and that Robby Anderson is likely to be suspended, Enunwa just might be the #1 in that offense. He has been plenty useful before and might return flex value if he gets the targets."
195,Jordan Wilkins IND ,"It isn‘t though Wilkins is some elite talent, although he seems to be underrated in that department too. Rather, Wilkins is worth drafting primarily because of the situation in Indy. Marlon Mack may not be able to handle a three-down workload which might just leave first and second down in Andrew Luck‘s offense open to Wilkins. Watch this one closely in case we get another Alfred Morris rookie season out of Wilkins here."
196,New Orleans Saints ,
197,Matt Bryant ATL ,
198,T.J. Yeldon JAC ,"Coming out of college, I was a huge Yeldon supporter, but he just looked over-matched his first two NFL seasons. Not that he was awful, just not special. It‘s possible that the Jaguars drafting Leonard Fournette was the best thing for him, as he looked sharp, fast, and spry last season while playing in a backup role, though it carried more responsibility than most due to Fournette‘s lingering ankle problems. Because of that, Yeldon should be considered as one of the best backups in football who can also contribute as a flex player in a pinch with how often they use him in the passing-game."
199,Danny Amendola MIA ,"There were some crazy rumors coming out of Miami early in the offseason suggesting that Amendola would see 100-plus targets in Jarvis Landry‘s old role. The issue with that was that the Dolphins signed Albert Wilson before him, and for much more money. Amendola will turn 33 years old this year and is not built for that type of role, as shown by the fact that he‘s failed to top 689 yards in his career, and has played 16 games just twice. He may have a higher floor than most in his range, but his ceiling isn‘t what some are making it out to be."
200,John Brown BAL ,"At this point, we have to admit that Brown is among the most injury-prone players in football, and while we don‘t want to see anything happen, you of course have to keep it in mind. If he plays, we might get a WR3 performance, but remember that Joe Flacco is the one throwing the footballs."
201,Mike Wallace PHI ,"Why do I feel like every time I see Mike Wallace‘s name, I think of the song “End of the Road”? It‘s been such a long career for Wallace at a high-level of production, but starting over with another new team at the age of 32? It feels like he‘s a slight upgrade over Torrey Smith‘s role on the team last year, leaving him off the fantasy radar. If something should happen to Alshon Jeffery, though, Wallace would be an immediate waiver wire add."
202,Christian Kirk ARI ,"The Cardinals lost over 200 targets this off-season and someone will have to step up as the Cardinals’ number two wide receiver. Granted, doing it as a rookie is always a challenge, but there is little doubting that he is the second most talented receiver on the team so this will be a battle to watch closely in the preseason."
203,Jordan Matthews FA ,"While Julian Edelman is out for the first four games, Matthews expects to see a larger role with the Patriots. We‘ve seen Tom Brady turn lesser players into household names, and if Matthews can get off to a hot start, don‘t be surprised if they keep him on the field."
204,Seattle Seahawks ,
205,Corey Coleman BUF ,"Going from the 2017 Browns to the 2018 Bills seems like a punishment, right? I mean, just when the future starts to look bright for the Browns, they ship Coleman off to what might be the newest version of the 2017 Browns. He‘s going to be in line for targets out of necessity, which is what we look for in fantasy, but just know that he‘s going to be inconsistent due to the lackluster quarterback play."
206,New England Patriots ,
207,Keelan Cole JAC ,"There are questions about how many snaps Cole will get each game in a crowded Jags’ receiving core, but it shouldn‘t go overlooked that he led the NFL in receiving yards over the last five weeks of the season. He could breakout if he gets the opportunity."
208,Spencer Ware KC ,"Kareem Hunt took the world by storm last year, but it was no different than what Ware did prior to his concussion in 2016. Now that he is returning from injury, don‘t discount the potential of Ware splitting the Chiefs’ running back duties, as Andy Reid has been known to allow in the past."
209,John Ross CIN ,"Just because Marvin Lewis didn‘t use John Ross last year doesn‘t mean that he is a crummy football player or that the Bengals won‘t get him targets this season. Granted, he is far from safe, but there is plenty of upside here to be found at the end of your drafts."
210,Jermaine Kearse NYJ ,"It‘s rare to see a wide receiver see 102 targets in a season, only to be cut the next, but it seems like a realistic possibility for Kearse. If released, the Jets would take no cap hit, and they have a pretty crowded room of wide receivers. He is a veteran presence, but on a rebuilding team, they may lean on others to fill that role. You should be avoiding Kearse in early drafts."
211,Darren Sproles PHI ,"He‘s going to be 35 years old this season, so there‘s plenty of reason to worry about his production, but whenever he‘s been on the field, he‘s done a fine job. In the first year of Doug Pederson‘s offense, he totaled 146 touches for 865 yards and four touchdowns. Many are chasing Jay Ajayi, but he was playing less than 30 snaps per game down the stretch in 2017. Prior to getting hurt, Sproles played 34 and 50 snaps in the first two weeks of 2018. By bringing him back, he‘ll be part of the gameplan, but he may take on a lesser role with Corey Clement emerging. Sproles remains the only running back to have played more than 43 snaps under Pederson, and he did it four times in 17 games. Rumors from training camp suggest that he looks like the same player he‘s always been, which would mean he‘ll make the 53-man roster."
212,Wil Lutz NO ,
213,Pittsburgh Steelers ,
214,Terrance Williams DAL ,
215,Carolina Panthers ,
216,Cole Beasley DAL ,"After posting at least 41 yards in 13-of-16 games in 2016, Beasley hit that mark just one time in 2017 and finished with a measly 314 yards. The Cowboys offense was a mess in 2017 and it‘s likely to be again in 2018, but the loss of Dez Bryant and Jason Witten could provide Beasley with more targets. Still, he‘s a low-upside target late in drafts, but one you can use if you‘re in a pinch."
217,Samaje Perine WAS ,"After being selected in the fourth-round of last year‘s draft, the Redskins apparently saw all they needed to see last year. Perine plodded his way to just 3.4 yards per carry and scoring one touchdown on 175 carries. Both he and Rob Kelley failed to distance themselves from each other, even when Chris Thompson went down with a season-ending injury. Because of that, the Redskins drafted Derrius Guice in the second-round in this year‘s draft. Perine is just a low-upside backup."
218,Kansas City Chiefs ,
219,Geronimo Allison GB ,"Possibly fantasy football‘s best kept secret to this point, as you have the chance to get one of Aaron Rodgers’ starting wide receivers essentially for free. With Randall Cobb playing the slot almost exclusively, Allison would start opposite Davante Adams in 2WR sets. Did everyone forget that James Jones caught 14 touchdowns from Aaron Rodgers a handful of years ago, only to retire a few years later? Allison has played 15 total games with Rodgers under center, and in those games he‘s totaled 45 targets, 26 receptions, 381 yards, and two touchdowns. That‘s some pretty good point-per-target production, and despite them drafting a few wide receivers, he‘s the only one who has experience in the offense, chemistry with Rodgers, and production to show he‘s capable. If for some reason, he‘s not the No. 3 receiver, we‘re going to simply replace him in the rankings with the player who is."
220,Albert Wilson MIA ,"Wilson figures to fit into the slot in this Dolphins offense and just remember what Jarvis Landry did out of the spot. Now, Wilson is not as talented as Landry, but there are plenty of targets to be had and Wilson figures to step into enough of them to be a safe depth piece."
221,Jake Elliott PHI ,
222,Javorius Allen BAL ,"It‘s unlikely that Allen sees the field a whole lot in 2018, unless the Ravens have completely moved on from Kenneth Dixon. Going back to the 2016 season, Allen touched the ball just 12 times. The Danny Woodhead injury at the start of 2017 definitely meant he needed to get more involved, but there are no guarantees this season. He‘s just a bench stash at this point."
223,Hayden Hurst BAL ,"The Ravens drafted Hurst to start and expect him to be of use in the passing game as a polished rookie. When you add in the fact that no one has thrown more passes than Flacco over the past two seasons, Hurst begins to look like an appealing breakout candidate."
224,Ryan Grant IND ,"I‘m not sure why so many are writing Grant off in fantasy leagues after he forced his way into the Redskins starting lineup despite many leaving him for dead. Once in the lineup, he produced with the targets he was given, posting 573 yards and four touchdowns on just 65 targets. During Andrew Luck‘s career, his No. 2 receiver has never finished with fewer than 56 targets, and there‘s no one competing with Grant for that spot. He comes with risk because we don‘t know what to expect out of Luck, but he also comes with upside much better than where his ADP is."
Tier 10,,
225,Matt Prater DET ,
226,Terrelle Pryor NYJ ,"Pryor has both elite athleticism and a big season in his past. Don‘t be surprised if he wins a starting job in New York and bounces back. He will have to get healthy first, however, which at this point looks like it may still be a while."
227,Brandon Marshall SEA ,"At this point, you shouldn‘t even be convinced that Marshall makes the Seahawks 53-man roster. At the moment he signed with them, he acknowledged he‘s not in football shape and has a long way to go. It‘s likely that Jaron Brown winds up as the better fantasy option."
228,Dan Bailey DAL ,
229,Chicago Bears ,
230,Wayne Gallman NYG ,"It‘s pretty sad to see Gallman‘s value go from usable bye-week filler to third on the depth chart, though that‘s what happened when the Giants drafted Saquon Barkley and snagged Jonathan Stewart in free agency. Truth be told, though, I‘d rather own Gallman than Stewart, as Gallman can contribute in the passing-game and is much more versatile. Whatever the case, he‘s only going to be usable if Barkley were to miss time."
231,Chris Boswell PIT ,
232,Luke Willson DET ,"It seemed like the Lions would add a tight end in the draft after cutting Eric Ebron, but Willson is the clear-cut starter as we head into the season. The Lions seemed to focus on using Ebron a lot more last year, though that may have had to do with trying to boost his trade value. Whatever the case, Willson will have the biggest role of his career, though it‘s likely not enough to be a weekly fantasy contributor."
233,Atlanta Falcons ,
234,Arizona Cardinals ,
235,Courtland Sutton DEN ,"It‘s highly unlikely that we see a whole lot of Sutton in year one, as both Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders were retained for the 2018 season. Sutton doesn‘t play the slot position quite yet, which will hinder his playing time."
236,Harrison Butker KC ,
237,Taywan Taylor TEN ,"If you‘re looking to hedge against the Corey Davis breakout that everyone is expecting, Taylor is someone that should entice you. He was one of my favorites coming out of the draft last year as someone who reminded me of Kendall Wright, but could play on the perimeter. He didn‘t get many opportunities with Eric Decker there last year, but Taylor did well with the 28 targets he did see, totaling 231 yards and a touchdown. He‘s going to be on the field in all 3WR sets"
238,James Washington PIT ,"It‘s almost as if everyone forgot that Martavis Bryant was traded and that Washington is going to start immediately, unless the Steelers drafted him to sit behind Darrius Heyward-Bey (they didn‘t). Yeah, he‘s a rookie, as was his teammate JuJu Smith-Schuster last year. Did we also forget about Bryant‘s 549 yards and eight touchdowns as a rookie, too? Washington‘s best attribute is adjusting, separating, and hauling in the deep ball, something Ben Roethlisberger is known for. He may not be an every-week fantasy starter, but he‘s going to have some big weeks."
239,Kalen Ballage MIA ,"When you see Ballage, you‘ll say to yourself, “he‘s a running back?"" He‘s a massive young man (6-2, 228) who excels in the passing-game, though he struggles in-between the tackles. Similar things were said about David Johnson when he came into the league, but Johnson has shown to be an effective runner. Ballage has to compete with Kenyan Drake and Frank Gore for touches, but he should get 4-6 touches per game out of the gate. If he impresses, he could earn more work."
240,Eric Decker NE ,
241,Tyler Kroft CIN ,"It isn‘t exactly fair to expect anyone to get hurt, but at this point in Eifert‘s career, it is the most likely scenario. If it does happen, Kroft was solid last season as a streamer scoring seven touchdowns so he could be a serviceable options here and there."
242,Sam Bradford ARI ,"Bradford is no lock to hold his job through the pre-season and we know he is as injury prone as they come, but if he does end up starting, Bradford offers much more than the general public will remember. He is by no means a QB1 or even close, but you can bet on him for a few strong streaming starts."
243,Mason Crosby GB ,
244,C.J. Prosise SEA ,"If you could go back and read some of the blurbs on Prosise from the last two years, you‘d wonder why everyone has forgotten about him. He was touted as a David Johnson-type running back who was a better receiver than he was a runner, which made sense having formerly played wide receiver at Notre Dame. He‘s the best pass-catcher in the Seahawks backfield and has produced while on the field, so I wouldn‘t simply forget about him. If he can stay healthy, he could turn out to be a Gio Bernard-type producer for them."
245,Ameer Abdullah DET ,"There is a chance that Abdullah gets cut, since it seems the Lions can‘t keep both Abdullah and Blount. Ameer isn‘t the favorite to win the job, but the battle also isn‘t set, so while he may be cut, he may also find a way into substantial touches should Kerryon disappoint in training camp and/or pre-season."
246,Jonathan Stewart NYG ,"You have to wonder if Stewart knew when he signed that the Giants were planning to draft a running back. Because as of now, Stewart might not ever play significant snaps ever again with Saquon Barkley in the fold. It seems that if something happened to Barkley, both Stewart and Wayne Gallman would split the load, though Gallman would likely have more value due to his contributions in the passing-game."
247,Joe Flacco BAL ,"If there was ever one thing that Flacco had going for him, it was job stability. You knew that by drafting him as your No. 2 quarterback in a 2QB league, he wasn‘t going to get benched. Now that the Ravens have drafted Lamar Jackson, those days are over. Flacco did get some increased weaponry in Michael Crabtree, John Brown, Hayden Hurst, Mark Andrews, and Willie Snead, but is it too little, too late? He‘s now finished as the QB20 or worse in three straight seasons and it‘s hard to trust him as anything more than a streaming QB2."
248,Dante Pettis SF ,"While I wasn‘t a huge Pettis fan coming into the NFL Draft, I must re-evaluate how I value you him considering the 49ers felt it necessary to trade up in the second-round to acquire him. He may not have a very significant passing role in 2018, but it shouldn‘t surprise you if they try to work him in a lot more as the season goes on."
249,Brandon LaFell FA ,"Once he stepped in for an injured A.J. Green in 2016 to produce 862 yards and six touchdowns, most though LaFell had developed a clear role on the team. The odd part was that even though John Ross didn‘t play, LaFell took a big step back and finished with just 548 yards and three touchdowns. My belief is that Ross plays a lot more this year, forcing LaFell to lose some much-needed snaps for production. He‘s someone you snag if Green were to get hurt again, but that‘s about it."
250,Zay Jones BUF ,"After finishing as the least efficient receiver in all of football last year, Jones will actually receive a downgrade at quarterback in 2018. On top of that, he may not be ready mentally to play football, as he had an ugly offseason mental episode that would up getting him hospitalized. If he is cleared, his path to targets is extremely easy, so it‘s impossible to completely dismiss him. It‘s still difficult to love him in fantasy on a team that might not throw 18 touchdowns all season."
251,Robbie Gould SF ,
252,Dallas Goedert PHI ,"He‘ll be taking place of Trey Burton, who had a few very usable weeks last year when Zach Ertz was ailing. He‘s going to have a few games that trick you into liking him more than you should, but you should know that the only time you should trust him in your lineup is if Ertz misses a game. If that should happen, Goedert shoots up into the TE1 conversation."
253,Antonio Gates FA ,
254,Elijah McGuire NYJ ,"It seemed that the retirement of Matt Forte would open some doors for McGuire, but the Jets have crowded their running back room, now having Bilal Powell, McGuire, Isaiah Crowell, and Thomas Rawls competing for touches. It‘s not going to be a high-scoring offense, so selecting McGuire even at the chance he gets as many touches as he did last year makes for an unexciting fantasy pick. The update on McGuire is that he broke his foot and will miss the start of the season, making him undraftable at this point."
255,Brice Butler ARI ,"I wonder if Butler is upset about his landing spot now that the Cardinals drafted Christian Kirk and they‘re saying that he‘ll be on the field no matter what. That means Butler now has to compete with J.J. Nelson for the No. 3 wide receiver role in the offense. It‘s going to be a run-heavy offense, so it‘s very unlikely he even has an impact if he does beat out Nelson. You‘re better off looking elsewhere in drafts."
256,Gerald Everett LAR ,"While everyone else debates which Rams wide receiver you want to own, it‘s very possible that Sean McVay overhauls his process and includes Everett much more in his second season. He was a second-round pick last year, so it‘s clear they loved his skill-set, though he topped four targets just once in 2017 and that was in Week 17 when they were resting starters. You don‘t want to bet on him being more involved, but being attached to a high-scoring offense isn‘t a bad thing for a former second-round pick. He‘s one of the higher upside tight ends going outside the top-20 at his position."
257,Willie Snead BAL ,"I‘m not sure if even Snead realizes how good he had it with Drew Brees, but the targets are going to be even cloudier in Baltimore now that they‘ve added Michael Crabtree, John Brown, Hayden Hurst, Mark Andrews, Jaleel Scott, and Jordan Lasley this offseason. Think of him as the Cole Beasley of the Ravens offense, but with better talent around him and a worse quarterback."
258,Kai Forbath MIN ,
259,Vernon Davis WAS ,"If and when Jordan Reed gets injured, Davis would step right in as a top 12 fantasy tight end once again. That doesn‘t mean he is worth drafting, but if Reed gets hurt during the pre-season and you need a tight end, rush to pick up Davis quickly."
260,Brandon McManus DEN ,
261,New York Giants ,
262,Jake Butt DEN ,"At this point, Butt is a complete mystery, but it wasn‘t long ago that the same was said about another Broncos tight end, Julius Thomas. Like Thomas, Butt has the skill set to excel in the red zone and this year, he figures to get an opportunity as the starter in Case Keenum‘s new offense."
263,Tyler Higbee LAR ,
264,Blake Jarwin DAL ,
265,Green Bay Packers ,
266,Curtis Samuel CAR ,
267,Chester Rogers IND ,
268,Josh McCown NYJ ,"It appeared that McCown was going to be handed the starting job for at least the first few weeks, but there‘s noise coming out of Jets camp that Teddy Bridgewater looks really good. With that being the case, it‘s hard to invest any pick in McCown, because we know that Sam Darnold will be given the keys to the offense before long."
269,Tennessee Titans ,
270,J.J. Nelson ARI ,"While many are stuck on Larry Fitzgerald and Christian Kirk, J.J. Nelson has fallen by the wayside. Truth be told, there may be room for him to produce more than most think. He saw 61 targets on this team last year that had both Jaron and John Brown combine for 124 targets. They are likely to run the ball a lot more this year, but Nelson should get first dibs on the perimeter as a starter. You don‘t draft him to be an every-week starter, but if you need someone to fill a bye week here and there, play him when it‘s a projected shootout."
271,John Kelly LAR ,"Owning handcuffs doesn‘t often make sense, but among them all, Kelly is by far the best option. He would come into a tremendous offense, seeing the bulk of the workload and has plenty of talent to be a reliable RB2 or even low-end RB1 were Gurley to get injured."
272,Rod Smith DAL ,"Smith is someone who is likely too low on everyone‘s board. While you can‘t project him as a top-50 running back, his value is greater than that as Ezekiel Elliott‘s backup. We saw him succeed behind a lesser offensive last year, totaling 232 yards and four touchdowns on just 55 carries, including another 202 yards and touchdown on 19 receptions. If anything were to happen to Elliott, Smith would become the waiver wire add of the year."
273,James Conner PIT ,"We aren‘t sure if the exit of Todd Haley will mean more snaps for Le‘Veon Bell‘s backup running back, but my guess would be no. In fact, we don‘t even know if the Steelers view Conner as the clear-cut backup to Bell, though he‘d definitely be in the mix for touches. He‘s just a unsure handcuff at this point."
274,Travis Benjamin LAC ,"There‘s not much love for Benjamin and that‘s because he‘s fourth on the Chargers depth chart. He scored just 4.5 fewer fantasy points than Tyrell Williams on four fewer targets, but one of them moves down the depth chart while Mike Williams moves up, and it‘s got to be Benjamin. He‘s one injury away from being fantasy relevant."
275,Cincinnati Bengals ,
Tier 11,,
276,Graham Gano CAR ,
277,Chase Edmonds ARI ,"Even though he was selected in just the fourth-round and he‘s now on a team with David Johnson, Edmonds may control his own fate during this offseason. Not only did David Johnson miss the 2017 season, but he‘s still yet to return to the practice field in what is a brand new offense. Johnson is also on the final year of his contract, meaning that if Edmonds continues to impress while Johnson is out, they may not want to pony-up a whole lot of dough this offseason to re-sign Johnson. Edmonds is just a handcuff at this moment, but he could be one of those guys who surprises if given the opportunity."
278,Ed Dickson SEA ,"There‘s a divide of analysts on Dickson, as some believe he‘s the clear-cut starting tight end in Seattle, but I‘m not willing to give him that title based on his body of work. He‘ll be 31 years old this season, on his third team, and has never eclipsed 528 yards in a season. Sure, he had a 175-yard game last year with Greg Olsen out, but he didn‘t top 36 yards in any game after that one. He‘s a fine No. 2 tight end, but I‘d like to think the Seahawks want their own third-round draft pick Nick Vannett to win that job as he enters year-three. Should Dickson be named the starter, he‘ll move up my draft board."
279,Jesse James PIT ,
280,Trent Taylor SF ,"It‘s difficult to figure out where Taylor fits in with the 49ers plans this year, as his 60 targets in 2017 were somewhat misleading. Not only was Pierre Garcon hurt for over half the season, but Marquise Goodwin took some time to get going. This offseason didn‘t help things, either, as the 49ers actually traded-up in the second-round to acquire Dante Pettis. While I believe Taylor gets the first shot, he‘s obviously on a short leash, which makes him a risky proposition."
281,Steven Hauschka BUF ,
282,Ka'imi Fairbairn HOU ,
283,Cairo Santos NYJ ,
284,Stephen Anderson HOU ,"It‘d be nice if we knew who held the Texans starting tight end spot heading into draft season, as they have the easiest tight end schedule in the league. Anderson had a few solid performances last year, including a five-catch, 79-yard, one-touchdown performance against the Titans in Week 13. Still, it could be Ryan Griffin or rookie Jordan Akins who takes the job. It‘s one to watch during the preseason."
285,Ryan Succop TEN ,
286,Keke Coutee HOU ,"It didn‘t take long for Coutee to start turning heads in training camp, just like I thought he would. He‘s a weapon who reminds me of Tyreek Hill, though he‘s not going to have the type of impact that Hill has with DeAndre Hopkins and Will Fuller on the field. Still, Coutee is going to have some big weeks if you‘re looking for someone as an upside bye week filler."
287,Jeremy Hill NE ,"After lighting the fantasy world on fire his rookie season, Hill has never been able to recapture that magic that won fantasy titles. He‘s averaged just 3.63 yards per carry since that time, but has been good around the goal-line (outside of 2017), scoring 29 touchdowns in his first three seasons. The Patriots obviously know his limitations in the passing-game and will likely have him and Mike Gillislee compete for the same roster spot. There‘s little reason to think Hill will pop back up on the fantasy radar."
288,Jeremy Maclin FA ,
289,Tavon Austin DAL ,"Tavon has a ridiculous contract, yet the Cowboys insisted on acquiring him anyway. Now, they are suggesting he may see a dozen touches per game out of the backfield. That is clearly stupid and not going to happen, but it is well worth noting that the Cowboys seem to have plans for him."
290,Tre'Quan Smith NO ,"He could have a Brandon Coleman-type season where he pops up on the fantasy radar for a week or two, but there‘s going to be nothing steady about his production unless something happens to Ted Ginn or Cameron Meredith."
291,Adam Shaheen CHI ,"So much for that second-year breakout that most were expecting when Matt Nagy was hired, eh? One of the first signings in free agency was Trey Burton, smashing the hopes of Shaheen supporters, as he‘s now become the backup. They have said that they will run plenty of 2TE sets, so it‘s possible that Shaheen gets on the field even with Burton, but there‘s not enough room for production. He‘s someone you snag off waivers should something happen to Burton."
292,Mark Walton CIN ,"Walton is third on the Bengals depth chart, there‘s no doubt about that. What‘s important is that he‘d only need one injury to contribute to fantasy leagues, as both Joe Mixon and Giovani Bernard are slated to receive 8-plus touches per week. Walton was likely brought on to be Bernard‘s replacement, as he‘s a free agent after this season. Walton is known to be excellent in pass-protection and someone who can play on all three downs if necessary."
293,Adam Vinatieri IND ,
294,Adam Humphries TB ,
295,Richie James SF ,
296,Josh Lambo JAC ,
297,Jaylen Samuels PIT ,
298,Detroit Lions ,
299,Kevin White CHI ,"You may be tired of taking a shot on White only to see him get injured, and while that is a possibility once again, you are getting him at such a great price this season that the risk may be worth it. He has all the talent in the world and if we can see him stay on the field, we might just be gifted with the year we‘ve all been waiting for."
300,Buffalo Bills ,
301,Alfred Blue HOU ,"After sitting out there as a free agent, Blue wound up signing with the Texans again. It may turn out to be nothing, but Blue did receive 46 carries over the teams final three games, including 22 touches in Week 17. If D‘Onta Foreman starts the season on the PUP list, it‘s possible that Blue is in a timeshare with Lamar Miller."
302,Teddy Bridgewater NYJ ,"It seemed like one of the oddest signings of the offseason, as the Jets already had Josh McCown on the roster and we knew they were going quarterback with the No. 3 pick in the draft. Still, Bridgewater has reportedly turned heads at Jets OTAs, making him legit competition for McCown as the Week 1 starter while Sam Darnold waits in the wings. If Bridgewater does win the job, he will be a low-end QB2 while he has the job with some upside if he regains the mobility he once had."
303,Robert Turbin IND ,"Putting Turbin inside the top-200 is not something anyone wants to do, but with reports that he may be the LeGarrette Blount to Frank Reich‘s offense, he should be moving up draft boards. While that role is extremely touchdown-dependent, it still has a place in fantasy football, especially when they‘re projected to be in the lead or in a projected shootout. I‘d likely rather roster a high-upside backup, but if you‘re desperate for someone to get 5-10 touches per week, he can fill that role."
304,Mike Davis SEA ,"You have to wonder if Davis is regretting his decision to re-up his contract with the Seahawks after they drafted Rashaad Penny with their first-round pick. Not only him is in Davis’ way, either, as Chris Carson has reportedly looked good in mini-camp. Davis is third on the depth chart and that‘s not even including C.J. Prosise, who may be playing wide receiver."
305,Lamar Jackson BAL ,"As it stands in June, it seems Jackson just may steal the job from Flacco. Whether that happens in the preseason or mid-season, he becomes a top 15 fantasy quarterback right away because of the floor his rushing ability offers."
306,Deon Cain IND ,
307,Taylor Gabriel CHI ,"The landing spot seemed much better for Gabriel before the Bears landed Anthony Miller in the draft, someone who will come in and demand targets from the get-go. Still, Gabriel is a speedy wide receiver that Matt Nagy will likely use in a variety of ways. Some have said he‘s the closest comp to Tyreek Hill on the Bears, but I‘d disagree on that. He‘s a field-stretcher who will see a lot of one-on-one coverage with Allen Robinson playing on the opposite side of the field. He‘s not going to be a weekly contributor, but think about someone like Travis Benjamin in 2017."
308,Corey Grant JAC ,"After watching Chris Ivory exit to the Bills, Grant has inched his way closer to fantasy relevance. With Leonard Fournette continually dealing with injuries, Grant should always be prepared to step-in alongside T.J. Yeldon should Fournette miss any time. In his short stints, Grant has impressed, totaling 412 yards and three touchdowns on 62 carries (6.65 YPC) the last two seasons."
309,De'Angelo Henderson DEN,"He was someone who made an impact last preseason, but it didn‘t amount to many touches in the regular season with C.J. Anderson, Jamaal Charles, and Devontae Booker in the mix. While Anderson and Charles are gone, the Broncos did draft Royce Freeman in the third-round. Still, it‘s possible that Henderson is a better running back than Booker and usurps him at some point. He‘s not draft-worthy, but he‘s someone to monitor in deep leagues."
310,Phillip Dorsett NE ,
311,Garrett Celek SF ,"You may be surprised to discover this, but in the five games Jimmy G started for the 49ers, Celek was a top-five fantasy TE while Kittle was top 10. Even though Kittle will likely end up higher this year, that doesn‘t change the fact that Garoppolo may be able to support two top 15 tight ends."
312,Chad Williams ARI ,"The forgotten man in the Cardinals wide receiver corps, but you really shouldn‘t forget about a guy they spent a third-round pick on just a year ago. If Sam Bradford can stay healthy, it‘s possible that Williams finds his way into a few fantasy relevant weeks, though he‘s far off the radar in standard leagues."
313,Dallas Cowboys ,
314,Baker Mayfield CLE ,"While I don‘t expect Mayfield to start Week 1, this has John Fox in Chicago written all over it. After saying that Mitch Trubisky wasn‘t going to start, they had no choice but to go to the rookie. While Tyrod Taylor isn‘t Mike Glennon-bad, he‘s not going to carry the team to new heights, which is what is needed to save Hue Jackson‘s job. If you‘re looking for a rookie to snag at the end of a keeper draft, Mayfield is the one to do it with, as he‘s got Russell Wilson-type upside, just don‘t expect him to start for at least half the season."
315,Jeremy Kerley BUF ,
316,Kenny Britt NE ,
317,Tampa Bay Buccaneers ,
318,San Francisco 49ers ,
319,Jakeem Grant MIA ,
320,Daniel Carlson MIN ,
321,Rico Gathers DAL ,"He‘s someone you need to keep an eye on throughout the preseason, as the Cowboys starting tight end position is wide open. He‘ll compete with a few rookies, making me believe he‘ll get the job after dominating last preseason. He gained almost 20 pounds this offseason to help with his blocking, but hopefully it doesn‘t take away from what he does best - catch the ball. With the lack of playmakers on the Cowboys, they need someone to step up and Gathers has it in him as a receiver."
322,Washington ,
323,Charles Sims TB ,"Most didn‘t even realize that Sims was a free agent this offseason, but he was, only to be unsigned all the way up to a week before the NFL Draft when the Bucs gave him a one-year deal. He‘s been really hit-or-miss throughout his NFL career, averaging 2.8 yards per carry in 2014, then 2.9 yards per carry in 2016, but he did average 4.9 yards per carry in-between those two seasons in 2015. He‘s a passing-down specialist, something the Bucs don‘t need much help with nowadays with all their receiving threats. Sims is just a boring fantasy option and one who shouldn‘t be drafted."
Tier 12,,
324,Nick Vannett SEA ,"There are a lot of fantasy analysts overlooking Vannett, who was drafted in the third-round a couple years ago waiting in the wings behind both Jimmy Graham and Luke Willson, who are both with new teams in 2018. Yes, the Seahawks did bring in Ed Dickson, but he‘s not someone who should eliminate Vannett from the starting conversation. He‘s a big, athletic tight end who could develop into one of Russell Wilson‘s go-to targets in the red zone."
325,Jalen Richard OAK ,"Despite averaging almost 5.5 yards per carry over the last two seasons, the Raiders felt it necessary to bring in Doug Martin this offseason, essentially destroying any value that Richard could have had in the offense. Both him and DeAndre Washington could be fighting for the same opportunity in training camp, and it might be better if they do release him so he can find a team who can use him."
326,Josh Hill NO ,
327,Antonio Callaway CLE ,
328,Josh Rosen ARI ,"It‘s possible that Rosen landed in the best spot for his chance to be the starter right away, as Sam Bradford has a bad history of knee injuries and still hasn‘t been fully cleared. With them both learning a new offense, it‘s well within the realm of possibilities that Rosen starts Week 1. He‘s still a rookie, so expectations must be kept in check, but he‘d be worth a draft pick in 2QB leagues."
329,Cody Latimer NYG ,
330,Phil Dawson ARI ,
331,Ryan Griffin HOU ,
332,C.J. Fiedorowicz FA ,
333,Malcolm Mitchell FA ,"With Julian Edelman‘s pending four-game suspension and the exit of Brandin Cooks, the wide receiver depth chart is sort of wide-open after Chris Hogan. Most have forgotten about Mitchell‘s last six games with Tom Brady that produced 25 receptions for 309 yards and four touchdowns. If Mitchell can bounce back from his injury that knocked him out of 2017, he could have a few fantasy relevant weeks."
334,Blair Walsh FA ,
335,Orleans Darkwa FA ,
336,Terrance West NO ,"The Saints are insistent that Kamara won‘t be a workhorse with Ingram out, and they just signed West, so you can expect him to assume the Mark Ingram role for the first four weeks. Granted, he isn‘t as good, but if you need a flex, remember just how good even Tim Hightower was in this role when Ingram was injured."
337,Virgil Green LAC ,"As of the time I‘m writing this, Green is slated to be the Chargers starting tight end, though I don‘t know if it lasts all that long. Despite lackluster competition on the Broncos, Green couldn‘t hold the job and was supposed to be the Chargers No. 2 tight end behind Hunter Henry. If for whatever reason the Chargers do move forward with Green as their guy, he‘ll move up the rankings, but his ceiling is nowhere near that of Henry or even Antonio Gates, who had serious rapport with Philip Rivers. He‘s 30 years old and has never topped 237 yards or one touchdown in a single season."
338,Dustin Hopkins WAS ,
339,Caleb Sturgis LAC ,
340,Jaron Brown SEA ,
341,Phillip Lindsay DEN ,
342,Kyle Juszczyk SF ,"It‘s sometimes easy to look over the fullback, buy Juszczyk has now totaled at least 33 receptions and 266 yards in each of the last three seasons. He‘s only totaled 14 carries over that span, but if you‘re in a league where you must start 3-4 running backs, he could be some cheap production."
343,J'Mon Moore GB ,
344,Torrey Smith CAR ,
345,Kendall Wright MIN ,
346,DeAndre Washington OAK ,"It seemed like Washington was all set to take over the starting role from Latavius Murray a year ago - then the Raiders signed Marshawn Lynch. It then seemed like he‘d take it once Lynch retired, but then the Raiders signed Doug Martin. It‘s clear that he‘s not in their future plans, despite being efficient on a per-touch basis. He‘s just a guy on their depth chart who‘ll pop at times, but there‘s simply too much salary/experience in front of him on the depth chart."
347,DaeSean Hamilton DEN ,
348,Justin Jackson LAC ,"Many are suggesting Eckeler is the backup to Melvin Gordon, but more likely, he will primarily help in the passing game. It is Justin Jackson who would likely fill in should Gordon go down, and with the offensive line, Jackson could be a star if that scenario were to play out and he saw major touches."
349,Shane Vereen NO ,
350,Tyler Boyd CIN ,
351,Adrian Peterson FA ,
352,Mike Gillislee NE ,"We‘ve come a long way since Gillislee‘s three-touchdown game in Week 1 last year, eh? Since that time, we‘ve seen both Rex Burkhead and Dion Lewis in extended roles, Jeremy Hill signed to a one-year deal, and then Sony Michel drafted with a first-round pick. It helps that Lewis left via free agency, but as of now, Gillislee is no lock to make the roster and it likely comes down to him or Hill. I‘d bet on Gillislee winning that battle, but his fantasy relevance isn‘t something that you should gamble on. If you play in a league where you draft over 200 players, sure, he can have some value as a high-upside backup, but it seems he found his way into Bill Belichick‘s doghouse and won‘t get out any time soon."
353,Thomas Rawls NYJ ,
354,Jamaal Charles FA ,
355,Joe Williams SF ,"Here we are, just one year after beat reporters claimed that Williams was going to take the starting job from Carlos Hyde. Not only did he not do that, but even now with Hyde gone, it seems Williams is firmly planted as the No. 3 running back on the depth chart behind both Jerick McKinnon and Matt Breida. While I wasn‘t on board with him last year, he might turn out to be a sleeper in drafts this year. McKinnon has struggled with early-down work throughout his career, and the 49ers showed no confidence in Breida as a workhorse when they signed McKinnon. He‘s nobody you should draft right now, but keep a close eye on him in the preseason."
356,Jonnu Smith TEN ,
357,Sam Darnold NYJ ,"With both Josh McCown and Teddy Bridgewater as veterans on the team, it‘s nearly impossible that Darnold starts before the second-half of the season. He‘s not someone you should be drafting, outside of deep 2QB leagues, but even then, you‘ll likely need the bench spots for someone who‘ll contribute sooner."
358,Jacquizz Rodgers TB ,"It seems like Rodgers might not even make the Bucs 53-man roster, as they will be carrying Ronald Jones, Charles Sims, and Peyton Barber clearly ahead of him on the depth chart."
359,Josh Allen BUF ,"As of now, it appears unlikely that Allen will start the season for the Bills, as A.J. McCarron is the front-runner for the job. It‘s only a matter of time before they go to Allen, though, so he‘s got some bench value in 2QB leagues as someone who will use his legs. His ceiling is capped due to the pass-catchers, but once he does start, he should be a semi-high-floor QB2."
360,Travaris Cadet BUF ,"Cadet didn‘t come to the Bills until later in the season, but when he did, he had a role in the offense. Over the final six games of the season, he carried the ball 22 times for 93 yards and caught 13 passes for 93 yards. With the lack of receiving options on the roster, it‘s likely that he‘s involved once again, though it‘d take an injury to LeSean McCoy for him to see a large uptick in production."
361,Clive Walford NYJ ,"Seemingly left for dead by the Raiders, the tight end-needy Jets decided to pick up the once highly sought-after Walford, who is still just 26 years old. They have last year‘s rookie Jordan Leggett coming back from injury, but he‘s essentially still a rookie. I don‘t expect much production out of the Jets tight end position, but if there‘s one who I‘d project to lead them in receiving, it‘s probably Walford. This is one positional battle we‘ll watch in the preseason to ensure we have it right."
362,Mark Andrews BAL ,"Andrews is someone who reminded me of Jason Witten with the way he maneuvered his way through routes in college. He wasn‘t fast, but seemed to get open quite a bit, becoming a favorite of Baker Mayfield in the process. He can‘t block very well, which may limit his playing time, as will their first-round pick Hayden Hurst. The Ravens use their tight end a lot, but knowing that Andrews was taken two rounds later than Hurst, he‘s clearly in a backup role."
363,D.J. Chark JAC ,
364,Oakland Raiders ,
365,Jordan Akins HOU ,
366,New York Jets ,
367,Cordarrelle Patterson NE ,
368,Michael Roberts DET ,
369,AJ McCarron BUF ,"It seems like McCarron is the favorite to start Week 1 for the Bills, but a non-mobile quarterback behind an offensive line that lost three starters this offseason? Not just that, but his pass-catchers are one of the worst groups in the league."
370,Charcandrick West KC ,
371,Carlos Henderson DEN ,"There are a lot of people who have forgotten about Henderson after he missed his rookie season with a hand injury, but he was the guy most compared to Golden Tate last offseason. He‘s a monster after the catch and can play anywhere on the field, though the slot is his likely destination in 2018. He got into some trouble this offseason, but if he can stay on the field, he‘ll have to beat out rookie DaeSean Hamilton, who is solid in his own right. Henderson is someone you should watch closely in the preseason."
372,Amara Darboh SEA ,"After losing both Jimmy Graham and Paul Richardson this offseason, the Seahawks are going to be looking for someone to find the end zone with a tad more frequency. Darboh is 6-foot-2 and 215 pounds, and could be the player to step into a starting role. He was drafted in the third-round last year, so the Seahawks obviously felt like he would be a contributor before long. He‘s one of those guys you can take with your last draft pick and you should know what you‘ve got after the first week or two."
373,Laquon Treadwell MIN ,"If something doesn‘t happen with Treadwell in 2018, it‘s likely not going to end well. He‘s now seen just 38 career targets over his first two seasons, hauling in 21 of them for 215 yards. The Vikings went out and signed Kendall Wright in free agency, though that seems to be a depth chart move with Adam Thielen occupying the slot. Treadwell should be on the field in 3WR sets, but if the past two years are any indication to his involvement, he‘s not going to be fantasy relevant."
